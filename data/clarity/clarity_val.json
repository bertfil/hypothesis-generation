  "question": [
    "Q. You alluded at the very beginning that the Chinese are not doing as great a job securing the border as they were before. You expressed some doubts when Kim went to see President Xi. The Russian Foreign Minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are underway. And the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade. So with all of those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions, how can you keep the sanctions regime in place? What leverage do you have on these countries?",
    "Q. With the NHS? With the NHS? Should the NHS be on the table, sir?",
    "Q. You mentioned American leadership. Is it embarrassing to you that the other party denies climate change\u2014[inaudible]\u2014the world?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?And, Prime Minister Trudeau, both\u2014I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?And, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border?",
    "Q. Did either of them talk about Syria without Asad?",
    "Q. Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said--Anthem BlueCross says that it's raising its premiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is so bad, and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs. One of the reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you've talked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need to plan for because of the energy bill, because of health care. That's what they say. I'm not saying it's true or not, but that's what they say. What do you say when you hear that?",
    "Q. Mr. President, how much are you willing to give? How much money are you willing to give Congress if they're going $6 billion more than you've offered?",
    "Q. That's quite a lead-in, Mr. President, thank you. Rick Ledgett, who is the head of the NSA task force on Edward Snowden, told 60 Minutes that it was, worth having a conversation about granting Edward Snowden amnesty. To what degree, sir, were you pleased that he floated this trial balloon? And under what circumstances, would you consider either a plea agreement or amnesty for Edward Snowden? And what do you say to Americans, sir, who after possibly being alerted to Judge Leon's decision earlier this week, reading the panel recommendations, believe Edward Snowden set in motion something that is proper and just in this country about the scope of surveillance and should not be considered by this Government a criminal?",
    "Q. Sir, why did you decide on $400, when previously families were receiving $600?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, in recent days, there's been a fair amount of discussion in legal circles about whether or not you might give preemptive pardons, pardons in advance, to officials of your administration who engaged in anything from harsh interrogation tactics to perhaps dismissing U.S. Attorneys. And I'd like to know, have you given any consideration to this? And are you planning on it?",
    "Q. It was whether or not you believe that the U.S. dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was right?",
    "Q. What responsibility do feel, as you're communicating about this, for the public to follow your directions and to take the prudent steps? And then, when you did use the word hoax, couldn't that cause some people to not take the precautionary steps because they are linking what you're saying, when you use the word hoax, in the context of coronavirus?",
    "Q. You spoke positively about the role of diplomacy in North Korea, and you obviously gave it a long time to work. Where does diplomacy fit in, in terms of Iran, and do we have any leverage if we try diplomacy there?",
    "Q. Back to Iran, sir. ABC has been reporting that Iran will be capable of building a nuclear bomb within 2 years. Have you seen evidence that Iran is accelerating its nuclear program?",
    "Q. President Trump said you would be making military purchases of military equipment. What does that signal? And is it a change?",
    "Q. Good morning, Your Excellencies. My question is to President Bush. Looking at Africa from afar, things might look bleak, but all may not be lost yet. A new Africa is emerging. But in your candid view, what do you think Africa must do, and what kind of leadership do you expect to see in Africa? And how will the U.S. help in this regard, to push forward the agenda to transform the continent into a better place for its people?And secondly, what do you hope to achieve from your five-nation tour, and why have you decided to visit Africa on the last lap of your term? And how do you want to ensure continuity in whatever you hope to achieve?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. One of the most significant events of this year was the revelation of the surveillance by the National Security Agency. As you review how to rein in the National Security Agency, a Federal judge said that, for example, the Government had failed to cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata actually stopped an imminent attack. Are you able to identify any specific examples when it did so? Are you convinced that the collection of that data is useful to national security and should continue as it is?",
    "Q. But to follow, we were speaking about the war, and during the campaign, two very different viewpoints of the war came out. You spoke a lot, as Bret mentioned, about what you saw as the Democratic approach to the war, which you were greatly concerned about. Are you worried that you won't be able to work with the Democrats, or do you feel like you have to prevail upon them your viewpoint?",
    "Q. As for criticism of your successor?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A new Senate report this morning contends that your administration was warned before the war that by invading Iraq, you would actually give Iran and Al Qaida a golden opportunity to expand their influence, the kind of influence you were talking about with Al Qaida yesterday and with Iran this morning. Why did you ignore those warnings, sir?",
    "Q. Good afternoon, gentlemen. For President Bush, how deep and how long will the economic recession be in the United States, and how will it affect Mexico?And what is your perspective, Mr. President, of the reform presented by President Calderon in Mexico?And for all three of you, what's the security context that exists with regard to what's happening to NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia after Colombia carried out a military invasion in Ecuador?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's been a lot of discussion surrounding this summit about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. And there's an untested and unproved\u2014unapproved drug in the U.S. that appears to be helping some of the Americans who are infected. Is your administration considering at all sending supplies of this drug if it becomes available to some of these countries in West Africa? And could you discuss a bit the ethics of either providing an untested drug to a foreign country or providing it only to Americans and not to other countries that are harder hit if it could possibly save lives?",
    "Q. A question from BFMTV. Both of you today have talked about coordination, cooperation against Daesh. Does it mean that this single coalition\u2014which you mentioned last week, President Hollande\u2014is gone? That it is inconceivable to have the Russians and the Americans to work together under this single command?And then Bashar al-Asad, you said you could not put a date on his departure. Does it mean that his departure is not a preamble or prerequisite for the future of Syria?",
    "Q. The troops that are massing on the border are more highly trained. They seem to have more sophisticated weaponry, according to intelligence. Does that make you reconsider\u2014as a few Democrats have suggested\u2014providing lethal aid to Ukraine, given those troop movements?",
    "Q. Two questions, if I may. First, did you learn anything new about Chairman Kim through this meeting?And secondly, of course, while this was going on, the drama back in Washington, your former lawyer, Michael Cohen\u2014who worked for you for 10 years; his office right next to yours, right by yours at Trump Tower\u2014he called you a liar, a conman, a racist. What's your response to Michael Cohen?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you, sir. What is the difference between what we're seeing now in Iraq and civil war? And do you worry that calling it a civil war would make it difficult to argue that we're fighting the central front of the war on terror there?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn't a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn't want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo.What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's been a lot of discussion surrounding this summit about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. And there's an untested and unproved\u2014unapproved drug in the U.S. that appears to be helping some of the Americans who are infected. Is your administration considering at all sending supplies of this drug if it becomes available to some of these countries in West Africa? And could you discuss a bit the ethics of either providing an untested drug to a foreign country or providing it only to Americans and not to other countries that are harder hit if it could possibly save lives?",
    "Q. If there were an alternative, would you want those tires swapped out?",
    "Q. Sure.Pandemic Adviser Atlas. \u2014\u2014in sometime no later than January. I mean, of course, it depends on when things are approved and the emergency use is given. Q. But what about\u2014I'm talking though about the low-priority people.Pandemic Adviser Atlas. I understand. Yes. I can finish. Q. Yes.Pandemic Adviser Atlas. And then, it is anticipated there will be 700 million doses by end of Q1. That's 700 million doses. Q. So by the end of March?Pandemic Adviser Atlas. That's end of Q1. Q. Dr. Atlas, do you mind if I ask you a question?",
    "Q. President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election? And did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? President Putin. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.I think there can be three questions from the Russian pool.Russia Today, you have the floor.Israel/Syria/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization [The reporter spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Thank you so much. And good evening to everyone. My name is Ilya Petrenko, RT TV Channel.[The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. First question for Mr. Trump, in English. Mr. President, would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the U.S. to work together with Russia in Syria, if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed?[The reporter spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. And my question to President Putin, in Russian: Since we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask\u2014I use the football language. Mr. Pompeo mentioned that, when we talk about the Syrian cooperation, the ball is in the Syrian court. Mr. Putin\u2014in the Russian court\u2014is it true? And how would you use this fact, the having the ball?",
    "Q. Good morning, Mr. President. Your former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, advocated for a lighter, more agile military force. Have you now concluded that that approach was wrong?",
    "Q. Next question, sir. The issue is inflation. TheGrio and KFF conducted a study of Black voters that said inflation was the number-one issue, and we saw it in this midterm election. What can you promise concretely in these next 2 years that will help turn the pocketbook for the better in the midst of staving off a recession?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Given the Republican nominee's recent comments about the Khan family and his statement that, if President, he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, does it make you question his fitness to be President?And secondly, sir, on Libya. You've said in the past that the worst mistake of your Presidency may have been your failure to plan for the aftermath of that 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. Do you see your new decision to bomb ISIS there as a direct result of that?",
    "Q. So does the mandate need to be enforced?",
    "Q. What are you doing as President to make sure there is a free and fair election?",
    "Q. Mr. President, why is he still at large?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the United States have a core national security interest in stopping the slaughter in Syria or merely a strong moral desire to see the violence end? And at what point does the cost of not intervening in a more direct way than you have done so far outweigh the cost of doing so?And if I may ask, President Park, President Obama's critics have warned that failing to act on perceived violations of U.S. red lines in Syria could embolden U.S. enemies elsewhere, including in North Korea. Are you convinced that Kim Jong Un has taken the U.S. and South Korean warnings seriously, and do you see the withdrawal of two missiles from a test site as a sign that he's willing to deescalate the situation?",
    "Q. Mr. President, what assurances\u2014what assurances do you\u2014what assurances do you have that providing F-16s won't escalate this war?",
    "Q. Jonathan Karl, ABC News. Madam President, thank you. Mr. President, thank you. It wasn't that long ago you were talking about a reset with Russia and were optimistic that relations with Vladimir Putin could be dramatically improved. Did you misjudge him, or did he mislead you? And at this point, isn't it clear that sanctions simply are not going to change his behavior? And just a personal relations question: I'm sure you saw, President Putin was asked that if he were drowning, would you save him? And he said he thought you would save him. So I'm just wondering, was he correct on that? And do you think that Putin would save you? [Laughter]And to President Park, in light of the fact that, as President Obama points out, North Korea is already the most isolated country on the planet, the most sanctioned country, what do you think should be done specifically if they go through with another nuclear test?",
    "Q. Is it your job to get a deal done?",
    "Q. Oh\u2014[inaudible]. Thank you.Sir, you've made it very clear in this conflict that you do not want to see World War III. But is it possible that, in expressing that so early, that you were too quick to rule out direct military intervention in this war? Could Putin have been emboldened, knowing that you were not going to get involved directly in this conflict?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014however inadvertently, you once said that you would like Tony Blair to stay for the duration of your Presidency. He's not doing that. Do you think you're partly to blame for that?",
    "Q. And on the domestic question, sir: What further specific executive actions are you considering in response to the Roe ruling? And would you declare a public health emergency as several Democrats are calling on you to do?",
    "Q. So is that a yes that you are running for reelection?",
    "Q. Well, I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] Q. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?",
    "Q. And if they do, sir, you will have to make that choice?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, on election night, you said that you were looking forward to speaking with Governor Romney, sitting down in the coming weeks to discuss ways that you could work together on this Nation's problems. Have you extended that invitation? Has he accepted? And in what ways do you think you can work together?",
    "Q. Yes, sir. Can we start with the $400, sir? So I just wanted to get your reaction. So you're saying the States will have to cover some of the costs, sir. Which Governors have told you that\u2014which Governors have told you that they would sign onto it?",
    "Q. Why did you come back, Mr. President? Why did you decide, after that\u2014because obviously, it created a lot of commotion\u2014what made you decide to come back and continue to the briefing?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you. Did you ask the U.S. Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts in eliminating ethanol tariffs in Brazil?",
    "Q. Anyway, moving on to the subject of the day, I talked to James Clyburn before this press conference. He said, As a man thinketh, so are we. And Americans believe we are in a recession. What will it take for you to say those words, that we are in a recession?And also, on Zimbabwe, what's the next step? And does South Africa play a part in that?",
    "Q. Mr. President, could you explain us from your point of view why it's not possible to agree on a no-spy agreement, which was, as we understood, proposed by the U.S. Government last summer? What kind of assurances could you give Chancellor Merkel with regard not only to ordinary German citizens, but to government members\u2014some of them sitting here\u2014that they are not under U.S. surveillance anymore?[The reporter continued in German, which was translated as follows.]And, Chancellor, the question addressed to you: When the French President was here a few weeks ago, after his talk with President Obama, he said that trust as regards to the NSA discussion has been rebuilt. Couldn't you say the same thing?",
    "Q. I have a question for President Lee. Korea and the United States have made many achievements through the summit meeting, especially North Korean nuclear issue and the strengthening of the alliance. As for North Korean nuclear issue, Mr. President Lee suggested setting up a permanent liaison office in both Seoul and Pyongyang. What are some of the follow-up effects, if you do have any follow-up actions? And do you have any thoughts of proposing a meeting with Chairman Kim at an earlier date?",
    "Q. So you're not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate, and you're not considering another plan B, then do you just wait it out, and we do go\u2014we do see all these things happen?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. On Venezuela, you did the tough sanctions, and you sent the aid, but it seems like Maduro is no closer to leaving. And I'm wondering if you're getting worried about losing momentum. And how long are you being told that this going to take?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to take you back to not this summit, but the one you hosted at Camp David a couple of days ago and whether you feel that you can ensure--assure investors there are contingency plans in place to cope, if Greece leaves the euro, to prevent a Lehman-like shock to the U.S. and the global economy?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The G-20 group today discussed the importance of tax fairness and consistency among countries. For you, how much of that discussion was centered on the Apple case and the EU's decision? And how do you balance your efforts here to ensure global tax fairness with your need and desire to protect U.S. companies and their shareholders?",
    "Question.Middle East Peace Process/Israeli Settlements Q. [Inaudible]\u2014Mr. President GeorgeW. Bush, you lead the superpower in this world. You launched war against Iraq after the Iraqi leadership refused to implement the United Nations resolutions. My question now is, what the problem to ask Israel just to accept and to respect the United Nations resolutions relating to the Palestinian problem, which\u2014[inaudible]\u2014facilitating the achievement of ending the Israeli occupation to the Arab territories and\u2014[inaudible]\u2014facilitating also the solution between Palestinians and the Israelis?And for Mahmoud Abbas, did you ask President George Bush to ask Israel to freeze settlements fully in order to enable negotiations from success?",
    "Q. Mr. President, for Republicans seeking election next year are you an asset or a liability?",
    "Q. Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.Mr. President Biden\u2014President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So what role do you expect of Japan?Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising, what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., R.O.K. becoming stronger in multiple layers?",
    "Q. Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Based on everything you know now, do you think that President Putin will authorize an invasion of Ukraine before the end of the winter?And what is your message to the roughly 30,000 Americans who are currently in Ukraine? Do you think that they should leave the country?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you did not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?And if I can do a compound question, the other one is, you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition, but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments, either expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the White nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under a President Trump as his chief strategist and senior adviser. What message does that send to the country, to the world?",
    "Q. [Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Repeatedly now, Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system. Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way? And are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the election? And if he does win, given that you have just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American people?",
    "Q. Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some on Wall Street have expressed frustration that it's unclear what more your administration is willing to do to resolve the banking crisis. The markets have remained in turmoil. So how confident are you that the problem is contained? And if it spreads, what measures, such as guaranteeing more deposits, are you willing or not willing to take?",
    "Q. I have a question for both Presidents. Mr. Bush, you said that you really appreciate everything that Estonia has done and that the U.S. is very interested in seeing Estonians visit your country. But you, as President, when will you be proposing to Congress this change in the visa laws to give us visa-free travel? And the second part of the question is, what should Estonia do in order to help you resolve this issue more quickly?",
    "Q. Mr. President, Mr. President\u2014\u2014 Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've been saying for months the virus would simply disappear, and now you're saying that it's likely to get worse before it gets better. If it does keep getting worse, if Americans keep dying, are you responsible for that?",
    "Q. No, no, I'm\u2014I'm going to take care.Mr. President, thank you. Sebastian Smith from AFP. Another question on Ukraine. Ukraine borders four NATO member countries. How concerned are you? Are you concerned that a real conflagration in Ukraine\u2014if the Russians really go in there\u2014that it could suck in NATO countries that are on the border and you end up with an actual NATO-Russia confrontation of some kind?And secondly, are you entertaining the thought of a summit with Vladimir Putin as a way to perhaps try and put this whole thing to bed, address their concerns, and negotiate a way out of this?",
    "Q. And given that previously in your Presidency you had sent a memo to the Office of Pardon Attorney saying there was sort of a predisposition against firearms to be carrying a clemency, why did you change your mind on that?",
    "Q. Thank you. Thank you, sir. How comfortable are you\u2014sir, how comfortable are you with your Homeland Security Secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you?",
    "Q. So my question is: Do you think that they are putting together a real alliance, the Chinese and the Russians? And do you believe that you need to begin speaking with President Xi about some form of arms control if he's going to get up to a level of weapons similar to what the United States and Russia have right now?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the United States have a core national security interest in stopping the slaughter in Syria or merely a strong moral desire to see the violence end? And at what point does the cost of not intervening in a more direct way than you have done so far outweigh the cost of doing so?And if I may ask, President Park, President Obama's critics have warned that failing to act on perceived violations of U.S. red lines in Syria could embolden U.S. enemies elsewhere, including in North Korea. Are you convinced that Kim Jong Un has taken the U.S. and South Korean warnings seriously, and do you see the withdrawal of two missiles from a test site as a sign that he's willing to deescalate the situation?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. I'd like to ask you about Iraq. Thank you. Yesterday in Dayton, in your remarks, you said that the Iraqi offensive against criminals and militants in Basra was a sign of progress. But it's also triggered clashes with supporters of Muqtada Al Sadr. And this morning, U.S. forces were again fighting the Mahdi army in Sadr City. What does this say about progress in terms of reconciliation in Iraq among the various factions? And what can the United States do, what can you do, what can your administration do to help Prime Minister Maliki make progress in that area?And, Mr. Prime Minister, if I could ask you, when you're in Bucharest next week at the NATO summit, what's going to be your message to the European allies to try to bring them along, to have the same sort of commitment you just stated here and a commitment to have military operations with their forces in Afghanistan?",
    "Q. Can you give an idea of what kind of steps?",
    "Q. I'm\u2014[inaudible]. Now, I'd like to ask a question about how to handle North Korean issues. Prime Minister Abe, the coordination for holding summits between the South Korea and North Korea, as well between the U.S. and North Korea, is underway, there is a concern in Japan that Japan may be left behind. So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. With some Republicans saying they need to see measurable progress by September, are you willing to reevaluate troop levels then, based on what General Petraeus says? And also, are you willing to accept any consequences for benchmarks in the war funding bill?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was\u2014a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism?",
    "Q. By end of the year or early next year? Or, what's your thinking?",
    "Q. Last question on humanity. Sir, you can't legislate and you can't Executive order out the issue of empathy or the lack thereof in the midst of this rhetoric\u2014this heated political rhetoric. What's next?",
    "Q. Mr. President, are you concerned about\u2014[inaudible]? Q. Mr. President, do you have an opinion on the Manhattan grand jury probably indicting your predecessor?Iran  Q. Mr. President, Iran keeps targeting Americans. Does there need to be a higher cost, sir?",
    "Q. Let me confess that I'll probably have more than one question myself. I'll be quick. President Obama, you said you're concerned with regard to defense cuts in NATO countries, but you said that freedom doesn't come without a cost. But Europe is coming out of a very hard crisis, difficult crisis, and we know that we need austerity in many sectors, including in defense. And in fact, there's a debate ongoing right now in Italy on a possible reduction in the commissioning F-35. So how can we reconcile the need to have fiscal discipline and to keep military spending under control? Now, you spoke about structural reforms. Do you think that's the best way to reinvigorate the country?Now, to the Prime Minister, did you talk about the Italian Marine riflemen during your talks?",
    "Q. Mr. President\u2014\u2014 The President. Yes. Yes.Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Q. Mr. President, you said that this will pretty much take care of the entire situation. But, as you said, there's not money for reopening schools, other important items. Is your administration willing to go back to Democrats to try to actually negotiate some of these big things?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you said today in a tweet that Dr. Birx was taking bait from Speaker Pelosi. What did you mean by that, considering that she was just describing the facts about the case of the pandemic right now across the country?",
    "Q. So will you take action\u2014on the border supplemental, can you act alone?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some say that Democrats who are facing tough races in November have asked you to delay action on immigration. How have the concerns of other Democrats influenced your thinking? And do you see any downside at this point to delaying until after the election?",
    "Q. Thank you. Mr. President, just to continue on that, when the NATO leaders gather in Chicago in May, do you expect that they'll be able to agree on a transition strategy? And are you concerned at all that the Koran burning and the episodes that have followed since then threaten your ability to negotiate with partners?",
    "Q. And for the Prime Minister, sir, who do you want to come see you as the next U.S. President?",
    "Q. What is your reaction to the MoveOn.org ad that mocked General Petraeus as General Betray Us and said that he cooked the books on Iraq? And secondly, would you like to see Democrats, including Presidential candidates, repudiate that ad?",
    "Q. Have you seen any evidence that Russia or China intervened in yesterday's election?",
    "Q. Well, let me ask you about\u2014you've spent lots of time talking about all the time you spent with President Xi and the importance of leader-to-leader communication, yet you two haven't spoken in 10 months. And I just wonder, are you worried that this is destabilizing the U.S.-China relationship? And what are you going to do about it?And then, if I may, on Ukraine, sir. Kyiv is upset\u2014[laughter]\u2014is upset that the G-20 communique didn't name Russia as the aggressor. Have you managed to rally more support or sympathy across the G-20, or is this emerging as a wedge issue with the Global South? And does that change your commitment to Ukraine?",
    "Q. Mr. President, the Iraq Study Group said that leaders must be candid and forthright with people. So let me test that. Are you capable of admitting your failures in the past, and perhaps much more importantly, are you capable of changing course, perhaps in the next few weeks?",
    "Q. And in terms of the G-7 Presidency, what do you want to do with it? What's your agenda in that?",
    "Q. Did they tell you this was going to come out today?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has has not sealed this border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you've left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014North Korean\u2014[inaudible]\u2014says that they don't want you to be a mediator in this case. How do you respond? And do you trust President Trump?And if you can take us to the moment when you are at the border, each of you\u2014you are at the demarcation line\u2014what do you believe that stepping over that line may represent for the United States and for the world?Thank you very much.Moderator. So you're first question was to President Moon, right?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Can you tell us if last night Philippine President Duterte offered his apology to you and if you said to him the U.S. will continue to help the Philippines push back against China? And last night, sir, Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin has been more of a leader than you, and then he said you have reduced American generals to rubble. Do you care to defend your legacy?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. How do you respond to those who say the election outcome, at least in part, was voters saying that they see you as out of touch with their personal economic pain? And are you willing to make any changes in your leadership style?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2010, you called the result of the midterm election a shellacking. What do you call this? And can you give us an update on your feelings about the immigration Executive order in the result\u2014in the aftermath of this election? Does the election affect your plans to release it? Will it still\u2014is it likely to come out before the lame duck session is over? And have you reduced its scope to just a couple million people?",
    "Q. And a subsidiary question, what do you think about taking it out of the political realm and giving it to an outside body of experts to take the politics out of Medicare?",
    "Q. If I may ask another question. In signing the peace treaty, do you hope to\u2014do you plan to work this out with North Korea's Chairman Kim only, or what do you think about the involvement of South Korea and China as the signatories?",
    "Q. So you have no regrets? You have no regrets?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, President Calderon. On the dismissal of U.S. attorneys: There have been allegations that political motivations were involved. Is political loyalty to your administration an appropriate factor? And when you talked to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last year, what did you say? And what did you direct him to do?",
    "Q. First of all, on Cuba, if I could, two questions. The Cuban Government has frequently said that it cannot allow more political or personal freedoms or press freedoms, because the United States has used both covert and otherwise actions to try to overthrow the Castros. Does your new era, in fact, end regime change efforts by the United States? And should the Cubans then respond by allowing free elections and tolerance of dissent now because of the changed policy?And secondly, on the issue of Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden, of course, said that the Democratic race is wide open. The polls seem to say otherwise. What is your opinion on that? Is the race still wide open?",
    "Q. On LGBT rights, we've seen a lot of achievements over the past 8 years, including signing hate crimes protection legislation, don't ask, don't tell repeal, marriage equality nationwide, and ensuring transgender people feel visible and accepted. How do you think LGBT rights will rank in terms of your accomplishments and your legacy? And how confident are you that progress will endure or continue under the President-elect?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With unemployment now at 9.2 percent and a large chunk of those lost jobs coming from the private sector, is now a really good time to cut trillions of dollars in spending? How will we still create jobs? And then to piggyback on the Social Security question, what do you say to members of your own party who say it doesn't contribute to the deficit, let's consider it, but not in the context of this deal?",
    "Q. Mr. President, if I could just ask you: You said the other day, in the Cabinet Room with African American leaders, you've got to get away from politics. You were down in Charleston last night, using the word hoax when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this. Do you regret that kind of talk?",
    "Q. Mr. President, as you're probably aware, there's a growing hunger strike on Guantanamo Bay among prisoners there. Is it any surprise really that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement?",
    "Q. And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment. As San Francisco DA, she oversaw, according to the Mercury News, 1,900 marijuana convictions. But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana, and she appeared to joke and, according to some people, lie, and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg and Tupac, while\u2014their music hadn't come out at the time, while she said she was smoking pot and listening to it. Why would she lie about that? Do you see that as more evidence? Is her past on marijuana a liability?",
    "Q. And then, my final question. [Laughter] Republicans have made it clear that if they do take control of the House, that they want to launch a raft of investigations on day one into your handling of Afghanistan, the border. They want to look into some of your Cabinet officials. They want to investigate you. They may even want to investigate your son. What's your message to Republicans who are considering investigating your family and, particularly, your son Hunter's business dealings?",
    "Q. Mr. President, is there a time limit on meeting any of these goals for Prime Minister Maliki? And you keep mentioning that the U.S. goal is to fight Al Qaida. Does that mean you believe it's up to the Iraqis to stop the sectarian violence and quell the sectarian violence, and this is something you don't want U.S. troops involved in?And, Prime Minister Maliki, can you tell us why you canceled the meeting last night?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. North Korean leaders apparently today warned South Korea against joining international sanctions, saying South Korea would pay a high price if they did so. Are you still confident that South Korea and China will implement the full force of the U.N.-passed sanctions? And what happens if North Korea continues to thumb its nose at the world?",
    "Q. So within that $2 trillion band, if you end up going for this middle-of-the-road package, which I think you referred to as the second option, would that need to have, for your signature, some sort of stimulative measures, either payroll tax extension or the extension of the unemployment insurance?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You were just criticizing the WHO for praising China as transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago. So, I mean, how do you square, your decision to revoke funding\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. I'd like to ask you about Iraq. General Petraeus and Gates are talking about a pause in troop reductions once we get to the pre-surge levels in July. Will that be it, or is it possible that there will be additional drawdowns before you leave office?And also, does the Iraqi Government's decision to host Ahmadi-nejad in Baghdad undermine your efforts to isolate Tehran?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Before I ask my question, I'm wondering if you could actually answer David's. Is the public plan nonnegotiable?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You came to Asia talking about the deep frustration that Americans feel about the slow pace of recovery in the economy, and over your travels in the past 10 days, you've been talking a lot about sustainable growth. But the American people don't seem as interested in gradual growth as much as they want real, noticeable help right now. Can you promise them that there will be, in fact, noticeable job growth during your 4-year term? And do you think that the unemployment rate will still be north of 9 percent when you run for reelection?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014and I wonder if\u2014are you giving Russian President Vladimir Putin the upper hand heading into your talks, given that you are challenging these alliances that he seeks to break up and destroy?",
    "Q. President Trump, the Washington Post, earlier today, reported that one thing holding up the GOP coronavirus bill is the White House asking that it include language regarding the FBI building in downtown Washington, DC. Is that true?",
    "Q. Good afternoon, President Bush and Prime Minister. And I thought that this summit would be the\u2014would\u2014actually Plan Mexico would come out of this, the combination of three governments to combat the effects of drug trafficking. What is the obstacle? What is it causing the delay? Why don't the societies of each country know what this plan is about? And can you actually confirm the support of the United States to Mexico? Apparently, it will increase tenfold, and the levels will be similar to Colombia. We hear very often that the United States wants to take part in this situation against drugs, this war on drugs, and we see it very clearly in Mexico. Now, what is it all about? Could you tell us?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Those of us who remember covering your campaign remember you saying that militarily, when the United States acts, it's not just important what it does, but how it goes about doing it; and that even when America sets its course, it's important to engage the international community and listen to different ideas even as it's pursuing that action. I wonder if you leave here and return to Washington, seeing the skepticism there, hearing it here, with any different ideas that might delay military action. For example, some in Congress have suggested giving the Syrian regime 45 days to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, get rid of its chemical stockpiles, do something that would enhance international sense of accountability for Syria, but delay military action. Are you, Mr. President, looking at any of these ideas? Or are we on a fast track to military action as soon as Congress renders its judgment one way or the other?",
    "Q. But will the United States recognize it?",
    "Q. Would you be willing to sign an immigration deal that ultimately does not include funding for the border wall? Or would that be a redline for you? President Trump. No. No. Q. No?",
    "Q. And President Erdogan: President Trump sent you a letter on October the 9th, urging you not to launch a military action into northern Syria. He said, quote: Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. You ignored that letter, and you went ahead, and you launched a military action into northern Syria. Can you explain why you ignored the President's warning?",
    "Q. Mr. President, concerning the nuclear\u2014the dispute about missile defense, the missile defense with Moscow, what concrete steps are you planning to convince President Putin that this is a good idea of NATO and the U.S.? And can the German Chancellor help you on this issue?",
    "Q. This is a question for both of you, but first for President Bush. Mr. President, many analysts say that the best thing for the approval in Congress of the free trade agreement would be the victory in November of Senator Obama. Do you agree?",
    "Q. A question going out to President Lee. As predicted, you just explained that you and President Obama discussed the issue of North Korea's impending rocket launch. But despite the international community's warnings, how will you respond if North Korea goes ahead and test-fires its long-range missile? What will Korea do? What kind of sanctions are you planning to impose on North Korea? And could you explain the status of the negotiations regarding extending the missile range of South Korea?You--in a recent press interview you spoke about the fact that discussions are proceeding between the U.S. and Korea regarding extending the missile range of South Korea. Can you explain or--the status of the negotiations?",
    "Q. Mr. President, would direct talks between the United States and Iran and Syria help stem the violence in Iraq? And would you agree to such a step?",
    "Q. Where does the people's right to know this fit into all of that?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What is the impact\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. German Press Agency, Kristina Dunst. Mr. President, your country is divided. You, as first Black President\u2014as first African American President, who did so many things so differently, who raised so much hope all over the world, do you think that you have, perhaps in a way, too\u2014put too much of a strain, maybe too much of demands on the Americans? And to what extent do you think your successor may well be a threat to the rest of the world, to the security? Because there are, after all, nuclear weapons here in Germany to which he has access now.Will you want to be now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under this\u2014your administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well?And a personal question: President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician. You are somewhat more sober in\u2014when you describe your partner. How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner?",
    "Q. Thank you. Mr. President, oil prices are up. The economy is in a serious downturn. What can world leaders do? And would you approve of intervention to strengthen the U.S. dollar, which many people say is contributing to the rise in oil prices?And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you believe that the U.S. is holding up moving forward on climate change?",
    "Q. And for President Niinist\u00f6, you've been working on fortifying the fence along the border between Finland and Russia. Is there anything that you're seeing recently that concerns you? And also, as a leader who shares a border with Russia, what more do you want to see done to deter Putin?",
    "Q. Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if, every day, Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more cases every day?",
    "Q. And my second question, on that note, to Mr. President Niinist\u00f6. Hearing this answer that no one can guarantee a future, are you worried that the political instability in U.S. will cause issues in the alliance in the future?",
    "Q. And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?",
    "Q. And you have many Americans now in Brazil for Carnival. What are your concerns? And what are the procedures and practices that you plan to implement as those Americans are trying to come back home?",
    "Q. But is there anything specific that you feel like you and your administration need to change given this disastrous election for your party and the message that voters sent?",
    "Q. But, sir, do you think Americans are going to face another 9 years of this terror threat, another generation? What's your message to them?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. How do you interpret last night's results in terms of deciding whether you want to seek another term? Is it now more likely that you will run? And what's going to be your timeline for consideration?",
    "Q. What is he recommending to you in terms of dealing with the latest strikes on Saudi Arabia and the response?And then, secondly, you announced new sanctions on Iran. Secretary Mnuchin said that this affects the last available funds for that regime. Have we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?",
    "Q. I am\u2014[inaudible]\u2014Daily. Now, the Korean Peninsula trust-building process has been the basis of the Korean Government efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. But despite these efforts, North Korea has really not changed its attitude towards developing nuclear missile capabilities. Now, in the second half of your term in office, how do you plan on steering inter-Korean ties?And one more. Now, from your visit to China in September, we have been seeing you say that you want to see unification of the Koreas. Do you really think that this will be possible during your term in office?And I have a question for both of you, actually, finally. In Korea, they say that you see each other often and you start to grow fond of each other. Now, this is your fourth time meeting as a summit meeting, and you also see each other a lot at multilateral talks. So I just want to ask, have you grown closer?",
    "Q. At your first press conference, 10 months ago, I asked you if there was anything you could do beyond legislation to protect voting rights. And at that time, you said, Yes, but I'm not going to lay out a strategy before you and the world now. Now that legislation appears to be hopelessly stalled, can you now lay out your strategy to protect voting rights?",
    "Q. How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support? For you personally, do you ever have trouble balancing the\u2014between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public, which is really the essence of democracy?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you've expressed frustration with Congress, obviously, over the economic\u2014wanting them to do more on the economy. They've blocked you on Colombia. They've blocked you on the FISA issue. Are you frustrated? Are you angry? And do you have any real hope of being able to work with this Congress this year?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you seemed to suggest, yesterday, that you're essentially committing to not spying on North Korea. Is that what you meant? Were those comments interpreted accurately? If so, why?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you've said you would help us with a Brexit trade deal. You said you'd stand by us with NATO, but how can the British Prime Minister believe you, because you have been known in the past to change your position on things? And also, may I ask a question to both of you? People are fascinated to know how you're going to get on with each other. You're so different: the hard-working daughter of a vicar, the brash TV extrovert. Have you found anything in common personally yet?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. U.S. intelligence has said that Russia tried to interfere in the last two Presidential elections, and that Russia groups are behind hacks like SolarWinds and some of the ransomware attacks you just mentioned. Putin, in his news conference just now, accepted no responsibility for any misbehavior. Your predecessor opted not to demand that Putin stop these disruptions. So what is something concrete, sir, that you achieved today to prevent that from happening again? And what were the consequences you threatened?",
    "Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I'd like to ask about two topics. First of all, what more specifically can the U.S. do to help Kenya in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still see Somalia as a counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about Kenyan authorities using counterterrorism as an excuse to commit human rights violations?Secondly, can you comment on the state of gay and lesbian\u2014the treatment of gay and lesbians in Kenya, which rights groups have called dismal and President Kenyatta has called a nonissue?For you, sir, President Kenyatta, on the same themes, what more do you need from the United States to help fight al-Shabaab, and are you getting it? And can you please also respond to criticism about the state of gay rights in your country?",
    "Q. Just to stay on that subject, if we may. Mr. Prime Minister, first of all, would you be prepared to talk to your predecessors, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, to get their agreements to release any documents if they are relevant to the paper search that the Cabinet Secretary will undergo?And, Mr. President, can I ask you--the Prime Minister says he opposes an inquiry. Hillary Clinton has demanded an inquiry. Where do you stand?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014who get infected. But when you're talking about the scope of this virus, when you look at the percentage of the population that's died, there's only three countries that have more deaths than the U.S. So how do you explain that: that\u2014why the percentage of the population who has died is so much higher in the U.S.? The President. Well, I think, actually, the numbers are lower than others. I'll get back to you on that. But we, proportionately, are lower than almost all countries. We're at the bottom of the list.And we're\u2014relative to cases, also, we're at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing, being at the bottom of the list. But I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we're, generally speaking, at the very bottom of the list. So I'll get back to you. Q. Because when I\u2014when I look at the Johns Hopkins, you know, Coronavirus Resource Center on their website, it says the most affected countries, when you look at deaths per 100,000 people of the population\u2014so how many people in the population have died\u2014you have the U.K., Peru, Chile, and then the U.S.You know, Canada has 8,000, 9,000 deaths. Obviously, they're smaller than us, but that's only 6 percent of the population\u2014you know, that's 6 percent of our total cases. So why are the deaths so much higher in the U.S.?",
    "Q. I want to ask you about a comment that Vladimir Putin said today. But why do you think he hasn't changed his behavior in spite of everything the U.S. has done to this point?",
    "Q. Do you believe it's a civil war, sir?",
    "Q. Is there a particular outcome that you would look for from this initial talk to judge whether you think things are going well? The President. Well, I think the minimum would be relationship. You'd start at least a dialogue. Because, you know, as a deal person, I've done very well with deals. What you want to do is start that. Now, I'd like to accomplish more than that. But at a minimum, I do believe, at least, we'll have met each other. We will have seen each other. Hopefully, we will have liked each other, and we'll start that process.So I would say that would be the minimal. And the maximum, I think you know the answer to that. But I think that will take a little bit of time.Okay? Yes.North Korea  Q. How long do you think that it will take you to figure out whether he's serious about giving up his\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. I'm wondering how much confidence does this give you to control the virus in the United States. And do you see the data China has been sharing with the United States has been helpful?",
    "Q. And the masks are making my glasses fog up, so I apologize too.Thank you, sir. On climate change: You just mentioned the incentives you have on renewable energy in your Build Back Better plan. You do have a number of incentives, but as it stands right now, there are no punitive measures in this plan to hold these companies accountable. And many experts firmly believe that you've got to have the stick along with the carrot in order to get to your goal to reduce emissions by 2030 by 50 percent. So can you stand here today and say to the world that you definitively will still meet that goal?",
    "Q. The Azerbaijan\u2014the Karabakh. And the civilians are killed. And according to the officials from Azerbaijan, they say the first shoot came from the Armenians. What's your comment on this?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014so you are stopping the military exercises with South Korea\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014but when you look back on your Presidency and consider race relations, what do you hope your legacy will be? How do you think the shootings in Dallas and the high-profile shootings by police and other events will shape the way your Presidency is remembered?",
    "Q. Did you discuss the potential closing of the border between Canada and the U.S.? And, by extension, are you considering ways to salvage the $2 billion daily trade between the two countries?",
    "Q. Did you agree that Huawei can sell to the U.S. or that U.S. companies can sell to Huawei? The President. U.S. companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. We're talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it. But the U.S. companies can sell their equipment. So we have a lot of the great companies in Silicon Valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment. We're letting them sell to Huawei.Turkey/Turkey's Purchase of Russian S-400 Antiaircraft System  Q. And then, on Turkey, sir, will Turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchases?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, you just spoke about looking forward and not backward, and you also referenced the voracious appetite of the American consumer. What role should the European and American consumer then play in the quarter that starts today? Should they be spending or saving to alter the velocity of what you just called a slow-rolling crisis?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your comment on Build Back Better and also ask you a question about the pandemic.You said that you're confident you can pass big chunks of Build Back Better this year. Does that wording mean that you are thinking about\u2014you're looking at breaking the package up into individual portions?And then, on the pandemic: Now that the Supreme Court has blocked the vaccination-or-test rule for larger businesses, are you reconsidering whether to require vaccines for domestic flights as a way to boost vaccination rates?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you. I wonder in light of the Supreme Court's decision if you could tell us what you plan to do with Guantanamo?",
    "Q. My first question is to Mr. Putin, Vladimir Vladimirovich. We can see from the declaration what you say about missile defense; the concerns are still there. Issues relating to the third site in Russia are still on the agenda.And my question to Mr. Bush: You talk about transparency. Will you be able to convince your colleagues in Poland and the Czech Republic to be as transparent as you are going to be in missile defense issues?",
    "Q. I'm a reporter from South Korea, and I appreciate your effort to advance denuclearization in Korean Peninsula. And could you elaborate on the options and the various ways that you discussed with Chairman Kim to advance denuclearization? Could you specify?",
    "Q. Sir, what does the new normal look like?",
    "Q. Will you let us know the results?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I've spoken to lawyers who say that they\u2014some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What's your reaction\u2014what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2010, you called the result of the midterm election a shellacking. What do you call this? And can you give us an update on your feelings about the immigration Executive order in the result\u2014in the aftermath of this election? Does the election affect your plans to release it? Will it still\u2014is it likely to come out before the lame duck session is over? And have you reduced its scope to just a couple million people?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Republican cochair of the supercommittee, Jeb Hensarling, went on TV today and said if the sequester happens--this idea of the automatic cuts in Medicare and defense--that there was plenty of motivation and plenty of votes to change the makeup of these automatic cuts.I know you had a conversation with him about this and said that that was--changing it in any way was off the table. That means you're going to veto this bill, if that's the case, if it ends up they can't get a deal in the next 10 days.And then, can you clarify your end of the hot mike conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as it involved Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Can you assure the American people that there have been no breaches of national security or classified information in the scandal involving Generals Petraeus and Allen? And do you think that you as Commander in Chief and the American people should have been told that the CIA chief was under investigation before the election?",
    "Q. President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?",
    "Q. As you know, a growing number of troops are on their second, third, or fourth tour in Iraq. There have been a growing number of reports about declining morale among fighting men. I spoke personally to an infantry commander\u2014tough guy, patriot\u2014who says more and more of the troops are asking, questioning what they're doing here. Does this come as a surprise to you? Are you aware of this? Is it a minority opinion? Is it a growing opinion? And does it concern you?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. During these first 100 days, what has surprised you the most about this office, enchanted you the most about serving this in office, humbled you the most, and troubled you the most?",
    "Q. So with a few crises behind us and a few more crises ahead of us, taking a step back from this specific debate over the sequester, how, as the leader of this country, do you plan to stop the country from careening to\u2014from crisis to crisis?",
    "Q. You do not believe that?And to clarify, on chemical weapons: Could\u2014if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from NATO?",
    "Q. Second to that, do you believe that China is sincere about what it said this morning?",
    "Q. So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think are going to die?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On immigration, many Democrats had more positive things to say about your comprehensive proposal than many Republicans did. Do you think a Democratic Congress gives you a better shot at comprehensive immigration reform?",
    "Q. Mr. President, despite the military success of the surge, there's no evidence that one of its intended benefits, making it easier for the Iraqis to form a unity government, has had any effect. Refugees won't come home from Syria. There was an opinion poll this week which said that most of the Iraqis surveyed blamed us, said things would be better when the U.S. leaves. What benchmarks can the Iraqi Government meet that would change this? What do you want them to do?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. I wanted to know: When's the last time you spoke with President Xi of China? And do you plan to speak with him in the near future?",
    "Q. But what about in the White House? What about in the White House, sir? You've got a lot White House staff. Some have been talking about leaving. General Kelly has been rumored to be leaving. Is he?",
    "Q. What's the high watermark, then, for unemployment? Eleven percent?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. I wanted to know: When's the last time you spoke with President Xi of China? And do you plan to speak with him in the near future?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to change the subject a bit. Earlier this year, on the flight to Selma, you said, on matters of race, as President, your job is to close the remaining gaps that are left in State and Federal government. Now, how does criminal justice reform fit into that equation? And what gaps remain for you\u2014in the\u2014towards the end of your Presidency? And also, what does it mean to travel to Kenya, your father's homeland, in the next couple of weeks as President to the United States? And lastly, would you revoke the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby?",
    "Q. Thank you. The President-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile. Given your own efforts at arms control, do you think that's an effective strategy? Knowing this office and Mr. Trump, how would you advise his advisers to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? And given your actions recently on Russia, do you think those sanctions should be viewed as leverage?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon. You just mentioned the new leader of France, and I was going to ask you about him. Have you talked to him? Are you recruiting him as part of the coalition? Any messages for him?And you've sent Mr. Cheney to the Mideast to visit with the other neighbors. What specifically are the requests you are making of them?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the Justice Department sending Federal agents into cities like Chicago as part of Operation LeGend. How exactly do you envision these Federal forces working alongside local police departments to help stop violent crime?",
    "Q. So no shutdown scenario for the mid\u2014for the lame duck?",
    "Q. As you know, a growing number of troops are on their second, third, or fourth tour in Iraq. There have been a growing number of reports about declining morale among fighting men. I spoke personally to an infantry commander\u2014tough guy, patriot\u2014who says more and more of the troops are asking, questioning what they're doing here. Does this come as a surprise to you? Are you aware of this? Is it a minority opinion? Is it a growing opinion? And does it concern you?",
    "Q. Are you wanting to do that? Will you participate?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to change the subject a bit. Earlier this year, on the flight to Selma, you said, on matters of race, as President, your job is to close the remaining gaps that are left in State and Federal government. Now, how does criminal justice reform fit into that equation? And what gaps remain for you\u2014in the\u2014towards the end of your Presidency? And also, what does it mean to travel to Kenya, your father's homeland, in the next couple of weeks as President to the United States? And lastly, would you revoke the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby?",
    "Q. How many? Q. Mr. President, how many people? Q. Was it at the event last night?",
    "Q. Again, Mr. President, would you be willing to go so far as to normalize relations with North Korea? And what about the idea of signing some sort of an agreement on the 12th to end the war?",
    "Q. I don't want to give anything away, but we saw your wife, the First Lady, drink a glass of French wine yesterday. So can you perhaps give up on your threat to put sanctions on French wine? Because if we've understood correctly, you have arrived at an agreement on taxing digital firms. Could you confirm that there has been an agreement between you and France on taxing digital firms?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that were on the agenda at the G-7 this weekend. The first was the Islamic State. You said yesterday, ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, that you'd assess what was working and what wasn't. So I'm wondering, bluntly, what is not working in the fight against the Islamic State. And in today's bilateral with Prime Minister Abadi, you pledged to step up assistance to Iraq. I'm wondering if that includes additional U.S. military personnel.Separately, on trade, Chancellor Merkel said today that she was pleased you would get fast track authority. I'm wondering if that means that you gave her or other leaders here assurance that it would go through the House. And if it doesn't, what does it say about your ability to achieve meaningful agreements with Congress for the remainder of your time in office?",
    "Q. What is your level of confidence that if you are able to reach a comprehensive deal with the Speaker, that he will be able to bring his members onboard and get it passed? Essentially, do you still trust Speaker Boehner in this process?",
    "Q. So you all had the call. You said that you told him that he had made a mistake. What was his response and did he acknowledge that?",
    "Q. Mr. President, like that cease-fire, you've called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza, but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far. Has the United States of America lost its influence in the world? Have you lost yours?",
    "Q. So you don't consider a potential traumatic brain injury serious?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your comment on Build Back Better and also ask you a question about the pandemic.You said that you're confident you can pass big chunks of Build Back Better this year. Does that wording mean that you are thinking about\u2014you're looking at breaking the package up into individual portions?And then, on the pandemic: Now that the Supreme Court has blocked the vaccination-or-test rule for larger businesses, are you reconsidering whether to require vaccines for domestic flights as a way to boost vaccination rates?",
    "Q. But that's an opinion, right?",
    "Q. The Prime Minister was pretty clear today at his own press conference that he considers this to be a temporary suspension and that the deal would still be open to him at some point in the future. I'm asking what you think he should do. Should he actually write it off?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a spate of recent stories about possible military action against Iran before the end of the year, if not by the U.S. then by Israel. And that prompted Iranian officials to say, if they're attacked, they'll essentially shut down the Strait of Hormuz. One, how confident are you that Israel will not act independently as the diplomatic process moves forward? And two, what do you make of the mixed messages out of Iran: one of defiance and one of willingness to negotiate?",
    "Q. But the results are being interpreted as a repudiation of your leadership style in some quarters. I wonder what your reaction is to that. And do you\u2014should we expect a very different White House? Should we expect a very different leadership style from you in these last 2 years, given that you have a whole new set of partners?",
    "Q. Thank you. The Attorney General acknowledged yesterday that there were mistakes in the firing of prosecutors. What is his future in your cabinet? Do you have confidence in him? And more importantly\u2014or just as important\u2014how effective can he be in Congress going forward when he's lost a lot of confidence among Democrats and doesn't have any defenders among Republicans?",
    "Q. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps 6 weeks or 2 months long?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've spoken a great deal about what you've characterized as kind of a crude form of nationalism, perhaps, on the rise. I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump. And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks.Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your Presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Asad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Asad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally. Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate. I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem?",
    "Q. And a subsidiary question, what do you think about taking it out of the political realm and giving it to an outside body of experts to take the politics out of Medicare?",
    "Q. Are you aware of or have you encouraged anyone in the party to help him get on the ballot, including in swing States?",
    "Q. Can I ask a question on the vaccine?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Germany has said that Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was poisoned. What do you think should be done to Russia about that? And what is your message to Russia about that? And how should the international community and the United States respond?",
    "Q. Mr. President, are America's banks in trouble? And does the rescue of Freddie Mae and Fannie Mac make more bailouts inevitable by sending the message that there are some institutions that are too big to fail and that it's okay to take risks?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014venue for your speech for the RNC nomination acceptance. What's your thinking behind that as a possible location?",
    "Q. Why do you think it's appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that they've meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because it's only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election?",
    "Q. President Bolsonaro, does the United States expect the influence of China into Brazil? Yesterday Paulo Guedes mentioned that it's going to incentivize relations with China. How does the U.S. see that, and what you said about President Trump, about the Chinese in Brazil?",
    "Q. [Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to go to--start with Libya. You had said that you want to see Qadhafi leave power, leave office. Are you prepared to use any means necessary in the United States Government to make that happen? And if not, why not? I know in the cases of some of these other uprisings there's been a careful consideration not to take sides, let the Libyan--let the people in those countries make this decision. But in this case, it does seem we have taken sides. So what--what's the red line here?",
    "Q. You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change. But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda. And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively. Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda? Or have you concluded that it's not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here?",
    "Q. When did you show that to Kim? What was the goal there?",
    "Q. Do you now see Kim Jong Un as an equal?",
    "Q. How long before health care ceases to become a political football, do you think? Are we talking years? Months?",
    "Q. How serious have your threats been to the Pakistani Government, if they don't hand him over?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With the flu outbreak spreading and worsening, can you talk about whether you think it's time to close the border with Mexico, and whether--under what conditions you might consider quarantining, when that might be appropriate?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. With some Republicans saying they need to see measurable progress by September, are you willing to reevaluate troop levels then, based on what General Petraeus says? And also, are you willing to accept any consequences for benchmarks in the war funding bill?",
    "Q. You're not bothered at all by the small missiles?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, President Calderon. On the dismissal of U.S. attorneys: There have been allegations that political motivations were involved. Is political loyalty to your administration an appropriate factor? And when you talked to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last year, what did you say? And what did you direct him to do?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it seems pretty clear where this Iraq vote in the House is headed. Your Press Secretary has said repeatedly that Members of Congress ought to watch what they say and be concerned about the message that they're sending to our enemy. I'm wondering, do you believe that a vote of disapproval of your policy emboldens the enemy? Does it undermine your ability to carry out your policies there? And also, what are you doing to persuade the Democratic leadership in Congress not to restrict your ability to spend money in Iraq?",
    "Q. But would you like the U.S. to export more oil and gas?",
    "Q. Yes. And will you talk about Georgia in a meeting with Mr.\u2014with President Putin?",
    "Q. As you know, a growing number of troops are on their second, third, or fourth tour in Iraq. There have been a growing number of reports about declining morale among fighting men. I spoke personally to an infantry commander\u2014tough guy, patriot\u2014who says more and more of the troops are asking, questioning what they're doing here. Does this come as a surprise to you? Are you aware of this? Is it a minority opinion? Is it a growing opinion? And does it concern you?",
    "Q. Hello. [Inaudible]\u2014Prime Minister\u2014 [inaudible]\u2014many times in the course of the last 6 years. But it's been 5 years since a leader of the British Conservative Party set foot in this city. Mr. President, does it surprise you that aides close to David Cameron say that he does not want to be seen with you? And can I ask you both what it means for the prospect of future relations between Britain and America when the leader of the opposition dare not set foot in Washington?",
    "Q. Do you have to support the war to support the warrior? I mean, if you're one of those Americans that thinks you've made a terrible mistake, that it's destined to end badly, what do you do? If they speak out, are they by definition undermining the troops?",
    "Q. Mr. President, on Iraq, you've talked repeatedly about the threat of Al Qaida in Iraq. And we've also heard a lot about the military progress that's been made against that group. Can you tell Americans how close the United States is to declaring victory against that group? And if you're not able to do so, does that suggest that your critics are correct that this war cannot be won militarily?",
    "Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Mr. Prime Minister. I'd like to ask a question about Roxham Road. The agreement has been ready for a year. Why did you wait so long?And for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.And so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle\u2014the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.Now, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.At the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere\u2014the Western Hemisphere\u2014in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.Thank you.Haiti [The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. Mr. President, this question is for you, but Mr. Trudeau\u2014\u2014[The reporter continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Please feel free, Mr. Trudeau, to answer as well.Are you disappointed that Canada is not part or hasn't taken a bigger role in the multilateral forces in Haiti? And what would you like Canada to do more, in addition to the $100 million announced today?",
    "Q. It will be over soon. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russia's involvement. You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria. If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them? And in\u2014on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train-and-equip program. Do you believe that that program can be fixed, or do you have to look at other options? Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several Presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. When you were running for President, you said: The biggest problems we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And that's what I intend to reverse. So my question to you: Has Congress's inability to do anything significant given you a green light to push the limits of executive power, even a duty to do so? Or put another way, does it bother you more to be accused of being an imperial President, pushing those limits or to be accused of being a do-nothing President who couldn't get anything done because you faced a dysfunctional Congress?",
    "Q. Just going off of Phil's [Philip Rucker, Washington Post] question, one, is your relationship with Mr. Kim stronger than it is with Trudeau? And do you plan on involving Congress\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. Thanks so much, Mr. President. Did you\u2014you say that you didn't issue any threats. Were there any ultimatums made when it comes to ransomware? And how will you measure success, especially when it comes to these working groups on Russian meddling and on cybersecurity?",
    "Q. Well, no, I'm asking the question about whether you're concerned. But isn't there something you took away and that you can offer to your successor about how it's risky in the process of sizing up your Russian counterpart? Don't you think that you learned something from your time with Putin?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you called for a deadline for U.N. action on Kosovo. When would you like that deadline set? And are you at all concerned that taking that type of a stance is going to further inflame U.S. relations with Russia?And is there any chance that you're going to sign on to the Russian missile defense proposal?",
    "Q. Has the American President calmed you in the sense that, on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia, he has allayed your fears? And how\u2014are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr. Trump, would you\u2014as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again?",
    "Q. I am surprised. Could I ask you about race?",
    "Q. Do you believe you have the power to grant work permits to those who are here illegally, as some of your supporters have suggested?",
    "Q. I want to follow on that by asking, under what conditions would you meet with President Castro in Havana? Would you have certain preconditions that you would want to see met before doing that? And on the hack, I know that you said that you're not going to announce your response, but are you\u2014can you say whether you're considering additional economic or financial sanctions on North Korea? Can you rule out the use of military force or some kind of cyber hit of your own?",
    "Q. If I could follow up\u2014\u2014 Q. Mr. President\u2014\u2014Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the drop of spread in China, the coronavirus cases. Is the U.S. Government considering evaluating similar measures in the U.S. in case the situation gets worse?",
    "Q. Do you agree with Republicans who say the election was a referendum, at least in part, on your intentions to use executive authority for immigration?",
    "Q. Well, I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] Q. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?",
    "Q. Just to stay on that subject, if we may. Mr. Prime Minister, first of all, would you be prepared to talk to your predecessors, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, to get their agreements to release any documents if they are relevant to the paper search that the Cabinet Secretary will undergo?And, Mr. President, can I ask you--the Prime Minister says he opposes an inquiry. Hillary Clinton has demanded an inquiry. Where do you stand?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You came to Asia talking about the deep frustration that Americans feel about the slow pace of recovery in the economy, and over your travels in the past 10 days, you've been talking a lot about sustainable growth. But the American people don't seem as interested in gradual growth as much as they want real, noticeable help right now. Can you promise them that there will be, in fact, noticeable job growth during your 4-year term? And do you think that the unemployment rate will still be north of 9 percent when you run for reelection?",
    "Q. Where were you taken, Mr. President? Were you taken to the bunker?",
    "Q. Two very quick questions, one for President Bush and the other for Prime Minister Berlusconi. Now, we know that you are in sound agreement. And, President Bush, I think that you were recently interviewed by my newscast, and you said that you were in favor of Italy being part of the 5-plus-1 group, which is handling the Iranian crisis issue.Now, Stephen Hadley said today that your position is that of waiting to see what might happen. Now, the White House was backing Italy's participation in the 5-plus1 group. So an answer on that.And, Prime Minister Berlusconi, will there be changes in Italy's presence in Afghanistan and other trouble spots after your talks with President Bush this afternoon?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke hopefully about your ability to work with Democrats, their willingness to work with you in this new world. I wonder how that's going so far, what you've learned about how they think, and does the current debate constitute grounds for divorce?",
    "Q. Edward Szall with TruNews. President Trump, your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century. My question to you is: Why were no Palestinians members of the White House peace plan committee?",
    "Q. You put your\u2014you put Vice President Harris in charge of voting rights. Are you satisfied with her work on this issue? And can you guarantee\u2014do you commit\u2014that she will be your running mate in 2024, provided that you run again?",
    "Q. Can I also ask you about FISA abuse, President Trump?",
    "Q. Eleven months later, where are they, sir?",
    "Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? And when can you guarantee that every single American who needs a test will be able to have a test? What's the date of that?",
    "Q. Absolutely. And we know you prize loyalty, so I wonder whether you felt betrayed by Scott McClellan's assessment of the war in Iraq? And moving forward, since there have been positive signs on the ground in Iraq, Senator Obama is about to take a trip there. What would be your advice to him as he tries to assess the situation on the ground?",
    "Q. Thank you. I'd just ask what do you say to those critics who argue you're trying to sow distrust in democracy and deliberately trying to sabotage the Post Office\u2014to undermining mail-in voting, which a lot of people need?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Given some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief, did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump Presidency?",
    "Q. Well, and given the fact that you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you thought about just\u2014once you'd made the decision to weigh in, why not just argue that marriage is a right that should be available to all people of this country?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Two questions. One is, you had talked about leaders who had called to congratulate you. Did President Putin call to congratulate you? And will you, in fact, meet with him at lunch this coming weekend?",
    "Q. Do you think it will change before you leave office?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you. Just to follow, I understand what you're saying about when you were informed about the NIE. Are you saying at no point while the rhetoric was escalating, as world war III was making it into conversation, at no point nobody from your intelligence team or your administration was saying, maybe you want to back it down a little bit?",
    "Q. Mr. President\u2014\u2014Injuries Among U.S. Troops Stationed in Iraq/Iran  Q. Mr. President, a question on Iran: Initially, you said repeatedly to Americans that after Iran retaliated for the Soleimani strike, no Americans were injured. We now know at least 11 U.S. service men were airlifted from Iraq. Can you explain the discrepancy?",
    "Q. And then, on\u2014on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?",
    "Q. With the increased slowdown in the drawdown here, we're looking at more risk, more danger for U.S. troops that are in Afghanistan. How do you justify that to them? How do you tell them that the mission is still worth it? And how do you assure them that there is an end coming to this mission?And for President Ghani, you've talked the last couple days a lot about the sacrifice of U.S. troops. You were at Arlington earlier today. How do you tell them that this continued sacrifice will be worth it to them as well?",
    "Q. Mr. President, what should Americans expect from Congress as it relates to abortion rights after the midterms?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister and Mr. President. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Mr. President, you seem rather to have changed your tune from what you said earlier this week, when you said that, on the current Brexit plan, that would probably kill the possibility of a trade deal with the U.K. Our countries are meant to have a special relationship, yet you publicly criticized the Prime Minister's policy and her personally for not listening to you this week. Is that really the behavior of a friend?And, Prime Minister, is it a problem for you that some of the things Mr. Trump has said about your Brexit plan are right? It will limit the possibilities of doing trade deals easily in the future. Can you also tell us how it felt for him to criticize you in the way he did in that interview?",
    "Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the National Intelligence Estimate that we are now in a civil war in Iraq? And also, you talk about victory, that you have to have victory in Iraq; it would be catastrophic if we didn't. You said again today that the enemy would come here, and yet you say it's not an open-ended commitment. How do you square those things?",
    "Q. Haven't you betrayed some of the voters who supported you in the election by changing your positions on who should get a tax increase and then by including Social Security benefits now in this mix? And more broadly, there seems to be a deepening sense that negotiations aren't going very well right now. Can you give us a candid update? Are we likely to go over the cliff?",
    "Q. And one more back to\u2014a quick one. Quick follow-up: Which loss last night surprised you the most? And which of these unsuccessful candidates are you most likely to consider for a future administration?",
    "Q. So not a full red line?",
    "Q. Voting by mail is a scam?",
    "Q. Will this be one of them?",
    "Q. But what do you, President Trump, expect Kim Jong Un to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people?",
    "Q. Were they yesterday at the event?",
    "Q. But there were phone calls, sir? Mr. President, there were phone calls?",
    "Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the National Intelligence Estimate that we are now in a civil war in Iraq? And also, you talk about victory, that you have to have victory in Iraq; it would be catastrophic if we didn't. You said again today that the enemy would come here, and yet you say it's not an open-ended commitment. How do you square those things?",
    "Q. President Bush, good afternoon. Mr. President, deportations continue. At the end of 2006, and only a week ago, this practice of deporting, of arresting immigrants and beginning a process of deportation, continued. In Guatemala, information of abuse of authority and lack of respect for the right of the Guatemalan immigrants has been disseminated. My question is, now that you are in Guatemala, is there a commitment from your country to the 13 million Guatemalans to cease these deportations since you expect to have a comprehensive immigration reform?",
    "Q. But what do you\u2014how will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your answer there about Russia and Ukraine. When you were in Geneva in June, you said to us, about President Putin, I think the last thing . . . he wants now is a cold war.Now, since then, of course, you've seen him gather these troops\u2014100,000 troops\u2014around Ukraine. Your Secretary of State said today he thought he could invade at any moment. You've seen the cyber attacks. And you've seen the demand that he have a sphere of influence in which you would withdraw all American troops and nuclear weapons from what used to be the Soviet bloc.So I'm wondering if you still think that the last thing he wants is a cold war. And has your view of him changed in the past few months? And if it has and he does invade, would your posture be to really move back to the kind of containment policy that you saw so often when you were still in the Senate?",
    "Q. Mr. President, Turkey's ground offensive in northern Iraq is now a week old with no end in sight. How quickly would you like to see Turkey end its offensive, its incursion? And do you have any concerns about the possibility of protracted presence in northern Iraq causing further destabilization in the region?",
    "Q. You and Prime Minister Gillard have outlined what is for us a significant new U.S. troop buildup. How much of this is because you're worried about the rise of China? And as of today's deal, U.S. Marines will be for the first time conducting exercises by themselves on Australian soil. Why is that, and what will they be doing?And, Mr. President, you also mentioned in your remarks that Afghanistan is not an easy mission. In the past few months, there have been three cases for Australia where our troops have been shot at by the Afghan soldiers who have been training, and sadly, four of our soldiers have died, and many others have been injured. Australian public opinion is strongly against our involvement continuing. You outlined the--just then, the drawdown. What can you say to the Australian people who don't want to wait, who want to leave immediately?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Patricia Zengerle from Reuters. There's been much criticism of U.S. monetary policy in the runup to this G-20. And with old G-7 partners like Germany opposing you, does this not make it much harder for the United States to press China for yuan appreciation and persuade other G-20 partners to support your goals if they sense that the U.S. is being isolated at the summit?",
    "Q. But, Mr. President, do you believe in climate change? Do you believe in climate change?",
    "Q. Good afternoon, Your Excellencies. This question goes to President Obama, but I would also like to hear the thoughts of President Aquino. I understand the tough balancing act that you need to do between China and your allies in Asia. But do you believe that China's expansionism is a threat to regional peace and stability? And will the mutual defense treaty apply in the event that the territorial conflict with China escalates into an armed conflict?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here?",
    "Q. Well, we try to be precise. [Laughter] So on Libya, when you say that you will be transferring command, when are you thinking of transferring command? And would NATO be the preferred partner to take over that command? And the second part of the question is that you have said that you want an alliance among equals with the peoples of the Americas. What deliverables are you going to go for after this trip to achieve it?And----[The reporter asked a question in Spanish, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. ----President Pinera, what is the content of this partnership so as to meet the goals of the region?",
    "Q. Any restrictions on who can give? Will you take foreign money for this?",
    "Q. Mr. President, when was the last time your spoke to Speaker Pelosi though? We're at this historic moment. Why haven't you spoken to her?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?",
    "Q. [inaudible]--a threat to us?",
    "Q. When you first ran for President, sir, you talked about the importance of accountability. We learned from Bob Woodward's recent book that Secretary Card, on two occasions, suggested that you replace Secretary Rumsfeld, and both times you said no. Given that the war in Iraq is not going as well as you want, and given that you're not satisfied as you just told us today, why hasn't anybody been held accountable? Should somebody be held accountable?",
    "Q. How, sir? What are you going to do about it, sir?",
    "Q. My question is about the switch of the G-8 summit from Chicago to Camp David. A reason given from the White House is that now you wanted a more intimate summit. People of Chicago would like to know, what do you know now that you did not know when you booked hometown Chicago for the G-8 that led to the switch? And what role did security threats possibly play in the decision?",
    "Q. Two quick questions. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, you said that voting by mail is an invitation to fraud. Could you lay out and tell us exactly where the evidence is right now that mail-in ballots in Nevada and other States will lead to widespread fraud?",
    "Q. I get another one. [Laughter] This is a good deal. Can you tell us whether you think your personal relationship with the Democratic leaders in Congress has had a negative impact on your ability to get your legislation through? And how important is that personal relationship?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Health care--as you're well aware, obviously, a lot of Republicans ran against your health care law. Some have called for repealing the law. I'm wondering, sir, if you believe that health care reform, that you worked so hard on, is in danger at this point and whether there's a threat as a result of this election?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, Mr. ElBaradei of the IAEA said today that Iran's progress in developing uranium enrichment is slow, and that its centrifuges are older models. So how do you reconcile that with the U.S. view that Iran is a major nuclear threat?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014Mr. President. What has President Zelenskyy told you about the big counteroffensive? And maybe you can start by telling us whether it's actually underway or not.And also, I'd like to ask you about the F-16s. You've greenlit them now. Jake Sullivan said arms and equipment go to Ukraine according to what he called the exigencies of the conflict. So what exigency now exists that didn't exist that demands these planes?",
    "Q. If you can get the Congress to protect telecom companies from lawsuits, then there's no recourse for Americans who feel that they've been caught up in this. I know it's not intended to spy on Americans, but in the collection process, information about everybody gets swept up, and then it gets sorted. So if Americans don't have any recourse, are you just telling them when it comes to their privacy to suck it up?",
    "Q. President Bush, you have already voiced your support in favor of our medics and their release. We appreciate that. Although, despite the fact that our fellow country people are still in prison\u2014absolutely innocent, as you well know\u2014I would like to ask you, as a part of the general effort to solve this drama, which has been going on for more than 10\u20148 years now, my question is: Would you commit yourself to lobbying in front of the U.S. Congress and doing so that some of the funds under your 5-year program for fighting HIV/AIDS can go to supporting the children infected with AIDS and their families?And, President Parvanov, I would be happy to hear your view on the Libya issue, and, notably, how would you comment the fact, or rather the Bulgarian media's idea, who are covering the trial in Libya, to send a letter to the hundred most influential representatives of the economy and business, according to the Forbes ratings, and call on them to donate to the building of modern, up-to-date medical center where children, all people, with HIV/AIDS could be treated?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. You've long talked about the importance when the Federal Government is involved in an effort, spending money and resources, of measuring success, accountability, as Peter said. Now you've set some benchmarks on the Maliki Government. You've said that you're expecting him to make tough decisions. Can you tell the American people how you plan to measure his success in reaching those benchmarks, and what happens if he doesn't hit those benchmarks?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession?",
    "Q. What are you going to do about it, sir?",
    "Q. On fentanyl? On fentanyl and energy consultations?",
    "Q. Do you have a response to the Governor of Missouri testing positive for coronavirus?",
    "Q. Do you disagree with P.J. Crowley?",
    "Q. The question to President Bush: Were you able to persuade France and Germany to give positive answer on the Ukrainian issue? And how your visit is remarkable to deciding\u2014to having that decision?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In his endorsement of you a few weeks ago, Mayor Bloomberg said he was motivated by the belief that you would do more to confront the threat of climate change than your opponent. Tomorrow you're going up to New York City, where you're going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather. What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change? And do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of a tax on carbon?",
    "Q. Good afternoon. President Bush, what is your opinion about the way in which the government has handled the scandal of the politicians involved in drug trafficking because\u2014and the paramilitaries?\u2014 because we know that there are many more members involved with the paramilitaries. Up to what extent do you support President Uribe given the fact that most of these paramilitary heads are drug traffickers? And finally, the U.S. will insist on extraditing these people?",
    "Q. It will be over soon. Thank you, Mr. President. There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russia's involvement. You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria. If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them? And in\u2014on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train-and-equip program. Do you believe that that program can be fixed, or do you have to look at other options? Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several Presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for?",
    "Q. Mr. President, in the wake of an avalanche of allegations made against Harvey Weinstein, your campaign is being subpoenaed for any documents relating to sexual harassment allegations made against you. Do you have any response to that?",
    "Q. Good evening to all of you. I also have a couple of questions, one for President Bush\u2014good evening, sir\u2014and it is about Iraq. You've spoken about a change in the country. Do you think it might be at all possible to have a withdrawal, maybe a partial withdrawal, of U.S. troops? And if so, when do you think that might be?My second question is for you, Prime Minister Berlusconi. Today the President talked about the fact that Italian foreign policy might change pace, as it were, thanks to the dialogue that has been established among the political forces in Italy. Do you think that is so, and if you do, how do you think you can uphold the dialogue with the opposition in Italy?",
    "Q. Are you worried this might dampen enthusiasm for you?",
    "Q. So when will the rest of America have the same access that members of your own White House have to testing?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. Jeff Mason from Reuters. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about your use of the word treason. You've used it repeatedly in the last few days. Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've made very clear that you're not buying Prime Minister Netanyahu's attempts to walk back the comments that he made before the election, opposing Palestinian statehood and that you're reassessing your approach. What could Prime Minister Netanyahu do, if anything, in the short term to persuade you that he's serious about Israeli-Palestinian peace and that he's an honest broker that you could work with? Or is it too late to repair that relationship during your Presidency? And is there any truth to allegations that Israel was spying on the Iran talks? And, President Ghani, if I may, you've been working very hard to pursue reconciliation talks with the Taliban, but there's some indications that that's not going so well and that they may not be willing to sit down with you. What makes you hopeful that you can get those talks off the ground? And do you want the U.S. to be involved in those talks?",
    "Q. Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian. In your trip to the U.K., there are lots of protests planned in London and elsewhere. How do you feel to it\u2014about that?",
    "Q. Before or after the election? Your election this year?",
    "Q. Yes. Both countries have spoken about the challenge of climate change. But there is a view that ambitious targets are set, but implementation is found often lacking. And there is also a criticism of lack of technological transfer, financial transfer from the developed countries to the developing nations.How do you both leaders see the way ahead on this pressing issue?",
    "Q. You've correctly suggested that the media can be impatient about seeing you--seeing both sides come to a deal, but this is your third budget, your third year of your Presidency. You've said many times that you'd rather be a one-party--one-term President if it means you've done the hard things that need to be done. Now, I know you're not going to stand there and invite Republicans to the negotiating table today to start hashing it all out, but why not? And since you're not, though, what more are you doing to build the spirit of cooperation you mentioned earlier needs to happen before there is bipartisanship?And finally, do you think the markets will wait 2 years?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said that the U.S. can't deal with Afghanistan without also talking about Pakistan. And yet there has been little public discussion at this summit about Pakistan's role in ending the war. In your talks with President Zardari today, did you make any progress in reopening the supply lines? And if the larger tensions with Pakistan can't be resolved, does that put the NATO coalition's gains in Afghanistan at risk?",
    "Q. ----sense of pride. In your view, how did reality match up to fantasy in welcoming the world leaders to Chicago? And did the demonstrators in any way on the streets undermine your efforts, Mayor Emanuel's efforts, to project the image of Chicago you would have liked to have seen?",
    "Q. Sir, can you take a question from the international media?",
    "Q. Are they qualified to be Commander in Chief?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned. But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he's chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year's campaign will be the new normal going forward in future U.S. elections?",
    "Q. President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?",
    "Q. I appreciate you making it a slow news week. [Laughter]I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what you're talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that these\u2014the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now you're saying you're making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue? And why did you change your position multiple times?",
    "Q. So she's going to stay on as Press Secretary?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. A quick clarification, and then my question. The $300 billion, is that from the Main Street Lending Program, or is that from a different part? Where are you pulling it?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Very quickly on Russia\u2014I do have a number of domestic policy issues, but I'm\u2014on Russia very quickly: It seemed like you said that you have assessed, you feel as though he will move in. Has this administration, have you determined whether President Putin plans to invade or move into Ukraine, as you've said?",
    "Q. Thank you. You said earlier that people in Iraq are sick and tired of the violence. To what extent has the recent Blackwater incident frayed your relations with Prime Minister Maliki and his Government? And why are outfits like Blackwater above the law in Iraq?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year, you said that you wouldn't extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the 1-minute-to-midnight scenario, that you're not going to back down?",
    "Q. Thank you. I wanted to ask you if you have learned more about the circumstances of Sergeant Bergdahl's capture and whether he could face any punishment given that the Pentagon has concluded that he left his unit? Also, could you respond to congressional Republicans who say that you violated the law by not notifying them 30 days in advance and that the release or the transfer of the Taliban prisoners could put Americans at risk? Did your willingness to go around that 30-day requirement signal a new urgency to close Guantanamo now that you're ending combat operations in Afghanistan?And also, President Komorowski, can you say whether the steps that President Obama outlined today to increase the U.S. military presence here in Europe are enough to mitigate whatever threat you see coming from Russia, or do you want more from the United States?",
    "Q. May I finish? May I finish the question?",
    "Q. When you talked about this in the past, you've minimized the benefits and you've highlighted some of the risks associated with that project. I'm wondering if you could tell us both what you would do when faced with that bill, given the Republican majority that we'll have in both Chambers, and also, what do you see as the benefits? And given the precipitous drop we've seen in oil prices recently, does that change the calculus in terms of how it would contribute to climate change, and whether you think it makes sense to go ahead with that project?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you pointed out this morning how much the NATO mission has changed. It's changed dramatically over the past decades. Russia still seems to be casting a huge shadow, most recently with missile defense, with NATO expansion. Has some things not changed? Can you avoid a\u2014what would appear to be something of a diplomatic train wreck when you meet with President Putin?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you think that Russia is applying undue pressure and threats to accomplish its goals at NATO on missile defense and stopping the Membership Action Plans of Ukraine and Georgia?And, Mr. President Yushchenko, what do you think of Moscow's tactics?",
    "Q. It was a supporter of yours. No\u2014\u2014Protests and Civil Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin  Q. To follow up on what Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN] was saying, are you going to condemn the actions of vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse?",
    "Q. Donatella Di Nitto of LaPresse. A question for President Mattarella: President Trump seems to being open on discussing the possible tariffs. So do you think it will be possible to avoid tariffs being imposed in 2 days' time?And a question for President Trump: Now, we all know your concerns concerning Huawei entering Italy's security system. Are you satisfied with the measures that Italy decided to implement?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you met a lot of leaders here; many were angry about the NSA story. Have you fixed the relationships with these leaders? And the second question is, many are shocked by the extent of which the NSA collects private data. Today we heard in the New York Times that you plan to end the systematic collection of data of Americans. But can you address the concerns of the Dutch and the rest of the world about their privacy?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014to use your favorite expression.After Brexit, who do you think will be your more important relationship: President Macron, France and the EU, or Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?",
    "Q. So you think there should be more indictments as a part of this investigation?",
    "Q. What will you do to support them, sir, outside Syria?",
    "Q. They expressed concerns though that it could exacerbate tensions and increase violence. Do you give any consideration to that?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You talk about the U.S. Government and the Iraqi Government working closely together on benchmarks. I'm wondering, sir, why was Prime Minister Maliki not at the news conference yesterday with General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad? Would that not have sent a strong message about there being a very close level of cooperation between the two Governments?",
    "Q. President Bush, in your assessment, what, if anything, was accomplished at the Baghdad regional conference? And what are your expectations for future rounds? Also, do you take\u2014do you believe that Iran and Syria were serious in their post-conference statements that they want to help stabilize Iraq? And if that is true, do you see a possibility of opening the way towards more formal direct contacts with those two countries?",
    "Q. Mr. President, this huge aid package to Puerto Rico: Why not a year ago? Why not 2 years ago? Why not 3 years ago? Why 46 days to the election?",
    "Q. Mr. President, the conservative newspaper columnist, Robert Novak, recently wrote that in 50 years of covering Washington, he's never seen a President more isolated than you are right now. What do you say to critics like Novak who say that you are more isolated now than Richard Nixon was during Watergate?",
    "Q. As you know, a growing number of troops are on their second, third, or fourth tour in Iraq. There have been a growing number of reports about declining morale among fighting men. I spoke personally to an infantry commander\u2014tough guy, patriot\u2014who says more and more of the troops are asking, questioning what they're doing here. Does this come as a surprise to you? Are you aware of this? Is it a minority opinion? Is it a growing opinion? And does it concern you?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you and then some for Chancellor Merkel as well. Your administration, tomorrow, is issuing a business advisory for Hong Kong. I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only\u2014is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated\u2014children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you're meeting today with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. You're meeting next week with Alvaro Uribe from Colombia. Two months ago in Trinidad, at the Summit of the Americas, you said that--you called on Latin American countries to help you with deeds, not words, particularly towards less democratic countries. Have you noticed any particular progress in these 2 months, and can you give us examples if so?",
    "Q. President Pinera, President Obama, good afternoon. President Obama, you have emphasized and highlighted the economic management of Chile, the leadership in the region--those were your words--and even the successful transitioning to democracy in the difficult years of the nineties. However, in Chile, President Obama, there are some open wounds of the dictatorship of General Pinochet. And so in that sense, leaders, political leaders, leaders of the world, of human rights, even MPs, the son of the murdered Orlando Letelier, Foreign Minister, have said that many of those wounds have to do with the United States. I ask you, Justice is investigating cases of Allende and the death of President Eduardo Frei Montalva. In that new speech that you will announce, is it--do you include that the U.S. is willing to collaborate with those judicial investigations, even that the United States is willing to ask for forgiveness for what it did in those very difficult years in the seventies in Chile?",
    "Q. I'm just wondering, is the net effect of what you tweeted this morning and what you're talking about now to cast doubt on the results of the November 3 election?",
    "Q. But just to put a fine point on it, are you actively discussing ways to remove him as a part of that political transition? The President. No.Major Garrett [CBS News].Possibility of a Federal Government Shutdown/Immigration Reform/Bipartisanship Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, the continuing resolution expires on December 11. Many things you've talked about on this trip are related to that: funding for coalition operations in Iraq and Syria, the Ebola outbreak, not to mention day-to-day Government operations. What are the odds the country will see itself in a shutdown scenario? How much do you fear the Government will shut down? And to what degree does your anxiety about this or your team's anxiety about this influence the timing of your decision on immigration and executive action?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014but the question\u2014but you didn't answer my question. Just very simply, the question is, why are you pitting Americans against one another, sir?",
    "Q. Mr. President, once again, a question with regard to arms exports. Do you think it is okay that NATO partners have different approaches here?And on Nord Stream 2, once again, do you think the current positioning of Germany with regard to the Russian threat is okay?",
    "Q. And then on supply chain, sir: One of the, obviously, big problems in the United States for supply chains is not having enough workers, not enough people to drive trucks to unload at ports, for example, and a lot of other parts in the supply chain. Workers have not returned to the labor force in America as fast as your administration thought they would. Why do you think that is? Why aren't people coming back to work?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the question of ISIS expansion that you've been talking about, because you see them expanding around the world, because you see them trying to inspire attacks, what is your current level of concern about the homeland? You talked about the protection measures, but what is your assessment about the possibility\u2014your own intelligence advisers suggest it's possible\u2014about the direct ISIS threat to Americans? And if I may follow up, somewhat along the same lines, what is your assessment today as you stand here about whether Donald Trump can be trusted with America's nuclear weapons?",
    "Q. Mr. President, Tom Bradby, ITV News. Quite a lot of people in the U.K. feel that your determination as a country to continue to push for the extradition of computer hacker and Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon is disproportionate and somewhat harsh. Do you think it is time now to consider some leniency in this case?And, Prime Minister, you've expressed very strong views on this matter, suggesting that Mr. McKinnon shouldn't be extradited. Your Deputy Prime Minister has expressed even stronger views. Did you discuss that with the President today? And if not, would now be a good moment to share your views with us once again?Prime Minister Cameron. Shall I go?",
    "Q. And on TikTok, sir, if you don't\u2014if you don't mind: The Commerce Department essentially gave you a runway today to strike a deal after the election. Do you expect the TikTok deal before the election or after the election?",
    "Q. Mr. President, just to make the point\u2014if it's unfair to the country and it's costing millions of dollars, why don't you just end it?",
    "Q. When you first saw this, weren't you angry? You didn't know about Syria. In 2005, you had the same assessment, with high confidence that Iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons. And now, quite the opposite. How can you possibly think the rest of the world is going to continue\u2014to the degree it did\u2014to rally around you and your intelligence?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The IAEA says that Iran has significantly accelerated its uranium enrichment program. And today President Ahmadi-nejad said that he would go ahead; he vowed to go ahead. There also is the detention of three Iranian Americans. Where is this all headed? And do you think it's time for tough U.N. sanctions with real teeth, and are you confident that Russia and China would go ahead?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've spoken a great deal about what you've characterized as kind of a crude form of nationalism, perhaps, on the rise. I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump. And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks.Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your Presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Asad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Asad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally. Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate. I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem?",
    "Q. I believe you do. But as you mentioned before, it will require Israel to make compromises to the Palestinians. As far as you know, is Prime Minister Netanyahu willing to make these compromises which are very much needed?And a second question: Mr. Netanyahu is about to indicted today in\u2014with corruption allegations. Do you wish to tell him something on this occasion?",
    "Q. What happens if that patience runs out?",
    "Q. So point blank, Democrats go after your tax returns, will you try to block that or will you allow them to have them?",
    "Q. First, my respect to both of you, Mr. Bush, Mr. Ilves. A question for Mr. Bush: You said that you discussed with Mr. Ilves the situation in Georgia. Estonia and the United States have helped in the development of this country of Georgia, and we are hoping to see some progress\u2014in this country. But the conflict between Russia and Georgia is putting a stop to this. What do you think we should do to help resolve this conflict between Russia and Georgia?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, the best. [Laughter] Thank you very much for hosting us. Also on China and tariffs: What do you say to Australian businesses and to Australian people who say that your trade war with President Xi threatens their prosperity?And to the Prime Minister, a linked question: Do you think that Australians are going to be collateral damage in President Trump's tariff war with China?",
    "Q. Mr. President, what are your thoughts about a second round of direct payments to Americans that's included in the House Democratic bill?",
    "Q. Yes. Mr. President, you've said that the arrest of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong is, quote, a terrible thing. Do you have a message for Jimmy Lai? Has your administration spoken directly with him? Is your State Department working for his release?",
    "Q. Would you like to extend New START? And will you raise concerns about violations of the INF Treaty?",
    "Q. Mr. President, it sounds like you're offering some way out here, some off-ramp. And it sounds like what it is, is\u2014at least in the informal assurance\u2014that NATO is not going to take in Ukraine anytime in the next few decades. And it sounds like you're saying we would never put nuclear weapons there. He also wants us to move all of our nuclear weapons out of Europe and not have troops rotating through the old Soviet bloc.Do you think there's space for there as well?",
    "Q. I believe you do. But as you mentioned before, it will require Israel to make compromises to the Palestinians. As far as you know, is Prime Minister Netanyahu willing to make these compromises which are very much needed?And a second question: Mr. Netanyahu is about to indicted today in\u2014with corruption allegations. Do you wish to tell him something on this occasion?",
    "Q. Do you have a plan to put something on the table?",
    "Q. No, no, I'm\u2014I'm going to take care.Mr. President, thank you. Sebastian Smith from AFP. Another question on Ukraine. Ukraine borders four NATO member countries. How concerned are you? Are you concerned that a real conflagration in Ukraine\u2014if the Russians really go in there\u2014that it could suck in NATO countries that are on the border and you end up with an actual NATO-Russia confrontation of some kind?And secondly, are you entertaining the thought of a summit with Vladimir Putin as a way to perhaps try and put this whole thing to bed, address their concerns, and negotiate a way out of this?",
    "Q. Can I ask about law and order?",
    "Q. Japanese press--Mr. President, from the Japanese media?",
    "Q. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President. First, a question addressed to you, Mr. President. There are\u2014were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered as regards your legislative term, for example, the closing down of Guantanamo or scrapping the death penalty throughout the whole of the United States, in all of the States. And now, as regards Asia and\u2014are you singling out Germany because there's a big risk here? Or\u2014\u2014And, Madam Chancellor, the Nobel Prize winner, Obama is waging a drone war also via Germany. And is he allowed to do that, according to German law?",
    "Q. Was it pretty far from the White House? Or was it right in front of that?",
    "Q. Thanks, Ma'am. This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India? And could you clear up for us what influence or encouragement your administration gave Australia as it made that decision?And also, the decision is so India can produce clean energy. In that regard, you're aware that our Parliament has passed a new bill pricing carbon, a carbon tax, if you like. But we're intrigued about where America is going on this issue. And countries like Australia don't see a carbon trading system in the world working unless America is a big part of it. Can you tell us, is it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so? How heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally? Or has this become too politically hard for you?",
    "Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'm\u2014[inaudible]\u2014with China's\u2014[inaudible]\u2014Media Business News Organization in China. Just a little bit of follow-up on Huawei: You say you're going to discuss Huawei's entity listing soon. Is it possible\u2014would you say it's a possibility that Huawei is going to be removed from the list? The President. Is it going to what? Q. Removed from the entity list. Is it possible?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Is that on? There. What is your current view on Brexit, sir? Should Britain leave the European Union if there is no agreement by October 31?And for the Prime Minister, what would be the ramifications for the U.K. if there is not a deal?",
    "Q. If I may, a second question. In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization. To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. Mr.\u2014\u2014Corruption Issues in Ukraine  Q. What about Biden? What about Mr. Biden? Q. What did you want about Biden? What did you want him to look into on Biden?",
    "Q. Why should the public trust the Government to handle that authority well?",
    "Q. Another press conference?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder if I can get you to weigh in on the wisdom of building a mosque a couple of blocks from Ground Zero. We know that the organizers have the constitutional right. What would it say about this country if they were somehow talked out of doing that? And hasn't the Florida minister's threat to burn a couple hundred copies of the Koran, hasn't the threat itself put American lives in danger, sir?",
    "Q. And what was that experience like for you?",
    "Q. You recently spoke just earlier about the importance of oil revenue sharing in Iraq. Recently, a company called Hunt Oil, run by one of your long-time supporters, Ray Hunt, signed a deal with a Kurdish regional government to drill for oil up there. That deal has come under intense criticism from the national Government in Baghdad. They say it undermines the discussions about oil legislation. What's your opinion of that kind of deal and how it impacts this long-stalled legislation?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Heading into Laos, what are the main things you can offer its leaders? And what do you plan to push for in return? On the offering side, for example, I'm wondering how you view U.S. responsibility for unexploded ordnance. On the asking side, what are you pushing for most? Is it human rights? Closer U.S. ties in the face of China? Improving their problems with governance and corruption? What's the priority?",
    "Q. Mr. President, I want to talk about Vladimir Putin again. Just to be clear, do you believe Vladimir Putin himself authorized the hack? And do you believe he authorized that to help Donald Trump? And on the intelligence, one of the things Donald Trump cites is Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction, and that they were never found. Can you say, unequivocally, that this was not China, that this was not a 400-pound guy sitting on his bed, as Donald Trump says? And do these types of tweets and kinds of statements from Donald Trump embolden the Russians?",
    "Q. And on Omicron and education, teachers are in result in some\u2014in revolt in so many places. Parents are at odds over closing schools and remote learning. You say we're not going to go back to closing schools\u2014you said that just moments ago\u2014yet they're closing in some areas. What do you say to those teachers and principals and parents about school closings? And what can your administration do to help make up for learning loss for students?",
    "Q. So when do you want to see it available? What would be a timeline that you would be happy with?",
    "Q. Yes, but\u2014okay.Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Former President Jimmy Carter  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday former President Jimmy Carter suggested that your Presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the White House with help from Russia. Your reaction to that, sir?",
    "Q. Thanks, gentlemen. Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, Phil Coorey from the Financial Review. To you, Mr. Trump, just on the region and China and associated issues, the United States Navy has conducted, frequently, freedom-of-navigation sail-throughs through the disputed areas. Would you like to see the Australian Navy participate directly in those operations alongside their U.S. allies?And whilst on the region, could I ask you what your latest thinking is on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Are you softening your opposition to that, or do you remain as opposed as ever?",
    "Q. You do not believe that?And to clarify, on chemical weapons: Could\u2014if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from NATO?",
    "Q. Okay. Can I ask one more question?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2022, you presided over a bipartisan international coalition to support Ukraine. How will you keep that coalition from fraying in 2023?And, President Zelenskyy, welcome to Washington on this beautiful winter day. What is your message to the American people?",
    "Q. \u2014\u2014of inflation. Oil prices have been at about a 7-year high recently. How long should Americans expect to face higher prices when they're at the grocery store or when they're at the gas pump? Is this something that they're going to see into the summer, into next fall?And separately, you know, you talk about the importance of the Fed, but isn't that an acknowledgment that you're limited in what you can do if you\u2014if you're relying on the Fed to make decisions and you're unable to get a Build Back Better proposal through, aren't you simply limited in what you can do to deal with inflation?",
    "Q. So that means that if the audit is still on, you will not turn over the tax returns, or you'll fight to block it?",
    "Q. Thank you. The President-elect has said that he would consider lifting sanctions on Russia if they substantially reduced their nuclear stockpile. Given your own efforts at arms control, do you think that's an effective strategy? Knowing this office and Mr. Trump, how would you advise his advisers to help him be effective when he deals with Vladimir Putin? And given your actions recently on Russia, do you think those sanctions should be viewed as leverage?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. There's a report that your Director of National Intelligence has ordered a broad review\u2014this is regards to the Boston Marathon bombing\u2014that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence gathering prior to the attack. There is also a series of senators\u2014Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham\u2014who allege that all these years after 9/11, there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack. And now, Lindsey Graham, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national security. Is he right? And did our intelligence miss something?",
    "Q. But my question is: Why not wear it more often or have the White House staff wear it more often to set an example for the country?",
    "Q. Can I ask you one last quick thing on China?",
    "Q. There was some uncertainty that brewed back in the United States over your statement that you said, When he says\u2014when he tells me that, I believe that he means it. That was taken in some circles, including Senator John McCain, to think that you believe that he is saying he did not interfere in the election. Could you, once and for all, definitively, sir\u2014yes or no\u2014say whether or not you believe that President Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election?",
    "Q. She said that your refusal to get testing up and running; your\u2014I'm paraphrasing\u2014your flip-flopping on social distancing and masks; and your delusional belief that you know better than the experts\u2014all of that, in her words, are reason that one American dies of COVID-19 every minute. What do you think of that?",
    "Q. And as a follow-up to the NATO meeting today, will you suggest to him, or would you consider stopping military exercises in the Baltic States if that's something that he requests?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the Justice Department. Do you believe that the seizure of phone records from Associated Press journalists this week\u2014or before that was announced recently this week was an overreach? And do you still have full confidence in your Attorney General? Should we interpret yesterday's renewed interest by the White House in a media shield law as a response to that? And more broadly, how do you feel about comparisons by some of your critics of this week's scandals to those that happened under the Nixon administration?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, the Chinese Government recently ejected several Wall Street Journal reporters. What is your administration considering to do in retaliation to that move? Are you considering banning or restricting the access the Chinese journalists, for example, have in the United States?",
    "Q. Next question, sir. The issue is inflation. TheGrio and KFF conducted a study of Black voters that said inflation was the number-one issue, and we saw it in this midterm election. What can you promise concretely in these next 2 years that will help turn the pocketbook for the better in the midst of staving off a recession?",
    "Q. [Inaudible]\u2014Polish Press Agency. I've got a question to President Trump. Do you share the conviction, which we have just heard a minute ago expressed by President Duda, concerning the threat which is posed to the region, but not only to the region, by Russia? And do you also share the view that permanent American bases in Poland are justified not only due to the security of the countries in our region, but also due to the security of the United States?",
    "Q. Just really quickly, you mentioned the issue of a two-state solution with Israel. I was wondering if you would give your reaction to what the Pope is moving forward with in terms of recognizing the Palestinian state. Do you think that's a good idea? Do you think it's a mistake? And do you think it might help or hinder the two-state solution that you mentioned earlier?",
    "Q. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President. First, a question addressed to you, Mr. President. There are\u2014were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered as regards your legislative term, for example, the closing down of Guantanamo or scrapping the death penalty throughout the whole of the United States, in all of the States. And now, as regards Asia and\u2014are you singling out Germany because there's a big risk here? Or\u2014\u2014And, Madam Chancellor, the Nobel Prize winner, Obama is waging a drone war also via Germany. And is he allowed to do that, according to German law?",
    "Q. Does anyone else need to go in the chain of command?",
    "Q. Thanks, Ma'am. This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India?

    "Q. \u2014\u2014Radio Liberty; Voice of America; Current Time TV channel, where I work, are branded foreign agents\u2014and several other independent media. So we are essentially being forced out in Russia 30 years after President Yeltsin invited us in.My question is: After your talks with President Putin, how interested do you think he is in improving the media climate in Russia?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you're facing a rebellion from Republican\u2014key Republican Senators who want you to change course and begin reducing the U.S. combat role. Given the mixed report that you present today, how do you persuade Republicans to stick with you as they look ahead to the next elections?",
    "Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about Russia. The Democratic candidates, when asked about the new Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, didn't appear to know a great deal about him. I wonder what you can say about him; how much power you think he's really got with Putin still in the picture?And critics would say you badly misjudged Vladimir Putin. So what would be your cautionary tale to your successor about the threat Russia poses and how to deal with this new leader?",
    "Q. Mr. President, the Attorney General's chief of staff testified that Gonzales knew more about the U.S. attorney firings than he let on. Now, how can the American people have confidence in an Attorney General who is not completely forthright? How long does he have to repair the damage? And can the damage be repaired?",
    "Q. Sir, Israeli Opposition Leader Netanyahu has now spoken openly about Israel's bombing raid on a target in Syria earlier in the month. I wonder if you could tell us what the target was, whether you supported this bombing raid, and what do you think it does to change the dynamic in an already hot region, in terms of Syria and Iran and the dispute with Israel and whether the U.S. could be drawn into any of this?",
    "Q. Mr. President, thank you. You acknowledged that this is a message election on the war in Iraq. And so the American public today, having voted, will want to know what you mean, in terms of course correction on Iraq. And particularly in light of this fact, that last week the Vice President pointed out that you and he aren't running for anything anymore, and that it's full speed ahead on Iraq. So which is it? Are you listening to the voters, or are you listening to the Vice President? And what does that mean?",
    "Q. Can I have a follow-up?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Hi there. After your discussions today with President Macron, what is your thinking about a timeline for bringing U.S. troops out of Syria?And on one other topic, you mentioned today that you thought the leader of North Korea has behaved openly and honorably. This is someone who many people have accused of starving his people, killing family members. What did you mean when you called him that?",
    "Q. And is nuclear happening?",
    "Q. Do you believe that a deal could have been reached without Israel's agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?",
    "Q. But will you pull out of the accord?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And two questions. There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House , from the Gang of Eight\u2014in the House, has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That's immigration.And second, on Mexico, yesterday the Mexican Government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry. Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico? Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained?",
    "Q. So your confidence in him wasn't shaken by him walking away from the big deal he said he wanted?",
    "Q. On the convention, were you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention?",
    "Q. You don't like giving money?",
    "Q. Good afternoon. President Bush, what is your opinion about the way in which the government has handled the scandal of the politicians involved in drug trafficking because\u2014and the paramilitaries?\u2014 because we know that there are many more members involved with the paramilitaries. Up to what extent do you support President Uribe given the fact that most of these paramilitary heads are drug traffickers? And finally, the U.S. will insist on extraditing these people?",
    "Q. [Inaudible]--from Korea's Yonhap News Agency. A question going out to President Lee. North Korea recently said that they will not return to the six-party talks. They have denounced the U.N. Security Council resolution and said they will not give up their nuclear weapons program. Can you, sir, talk about if--whether you talked about how you plan to proceed forward, and did you talk about this with President Obama?And of course, their continuing threat emanating from North Korea--a South Korean worker has been and is still detained by the North Koreans. What are your thoughts about the maintenance of the Kaesong industrial complex, and did you talk about--President Obama--or were there any concerns from the Americans about the Kaesong industrial complex?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham both said today that they want to have Watergate-style hearings on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and said that if you nominate Susan Rice to be Secretary of State, they will do everything in their power to block her nomination. As Senator Graham said, he simply doesn't trust Ambassador Rice after what she said about Benghazi. I'd like your reaction to that. And would those threats deter you from making a nomination like that?",
    "Q. A lot of people in Europe are still struggling to understand what happened on November 8 in the United States. Do you believe it's the exact same dynamic as Brexit, which happened 6 months before? And does it have to do with leaders struggling to read the mood of their country? Do you have the feeling that, while in power, you underestimated anger or resentment or fear in America?And to you, Prime Minister Tsipras, President Obama has repeatedly said, including today, that Greece should get substantial debt relief. From your conversation with him today, do you\u2014are you hopeful that he might convince Chancellor Merkel to make a move in that regard later this week?",
    "Q. First of all, on Cuba, if I could, two questions. The Cuban Government has frequently said that it cannot allow more political or personal freedoms or press freedoms, because the United States has used both covert and otherwise actions to try to overthrow the Castros. Does your new era, in fact, end regime change efforts by the United States? And should the Cubans then respond by allowing free elections and tolerance of dissent now because of the changed policy?And secondly, on the issue of Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden, of course, said that the Democratic race is wide open. The polls seem to say otherwise. What is your opinion on that? Is the race still wide open?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you just said there's not a lot of excess supply out there. Some energy experts think we may have already passed or be within a couple of years of passing the maximum oil pumping capability. In other words, we may be close to tapping all we've got. Do you think that's the case? And if you do, why haven't you put more resources into renewable energy research, sir?",
    "Q. Do you have any\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. Does this mean the war in Afghanistan is over? Is the Taliban in charge? And secondly, Congressman John Ratcliffe, why are you renominating him?",
    "Q. Yes, sir. On the Middle East and as it relates to American politics, a little less than a year ago Muammar Qadhafi gave a speech, and he said he was going to send his forces to Benghazi, he was going to rout opponents from their bedrooms, and he was going to shoot them. You frequently cited that speech as a justification for NATO, the no-fly zone, and military action against Libya. In Syria, Bashar al-Asad is killing people. There's a massacre underway. And your critics here in the United States, including, most notably, John McCain, said you should start air strikes now.And on Iran, Mitt Romney, on Sunday, went so far as to say that if you are reelected, Iran will get a bomb and the world will change. How do you respond to those criticisms?",
    "Q. Jessica Stone from CGTN. I have a question about China, as you were talking about. You talk about China being willing, potentially, to help economically. And the fact that you've talked\u2014or will talk to Presidents Moon and Prime Minister Abe, how would you describe China's role in facilitating the engagement that's happened, so far, between Pyongyang and Washington?",
    "Q. Many analysts and some former members of your administration believe that the kind of negotiated political settlement that you say is necessary in Syria will require working directly with Iran and giving Iran an important role. Do you agree? And is that a dialogue you'll be actively seeking?And what about the fight against ISIS? What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran?",
    "Q. Mr. President, why are you not meeting with the family of Jacob Blake while you're there?",
    "Q. Mr. President, the Romanian people, the Romanians have a great expectations with regards to the very good ties, political and economic, between the two states. In a very practical manner, they will ask, when will we have the same regime as the other citizens from the European Union with regards to the visas? Could we have a deadline for this when we could travel freely to the United States?",
    "Q. Are you concerned about all that just like giving Kim the meeting, that he's getting a win as a deal\u2014[inaudible]?",
    "Q. [Inaudible]\u2014what are the chances, in your opinion, of achieving an agreement at Sochi on missile defense?",
    "Q. Mr. President, would direct talks between the United States and Iran and Syria help stem the violence in Iraq? And would you agree to such a step?",
    "Q. Mr. President, I want to get your thoughts about the volatility in the financial markets, but specifically, a series of questions. Do you think that housing prices will continue to fall? Do you think that the inability of people to borrow money the way they used to is going to spill over into economy generally? And what are you prepared to do about it? And specifically, are you considering some kind of government bailout for people who might lose their homes?",
    "Q. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President. First, a question addressed to you, Mr. President. There are\u2014were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered as regards your legislative term, for example, the closing down of Guantanamo or scrapping the death penalty throughout the whole of the United States, in all of the States. And now, as regards Asia and\u2014are you singling out Germany because there's a big risk here? Or\u2014\u2014And, Madam Chancellor, the Nobel Prize winner, Obama is waging a drone war also via Germany. And is he allowed to do that, according to German law?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have been a strong supporter of the idea of a peaceful transfer of power, demonstrated not terribly far from here, out in the Rose Garden. And yet, even as you and I speak, there are more than five dozen Democrats that are going to boycott the Inauguration of the incoming President. Do you support that? And what message would you send to Democrats to better demonstrate the peaceful transfer of power?And if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the President-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I'm just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with: maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation. Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you?",
    "Q. But, sir, are you reversing the statement? You never answered about the statement. Just\u2014I'll just let you go after this, but do you want to reverse what you told Woodward about the 13- to 14-month timeline for a vaccine?",
    "Q. Does this mean the war in Afghanistan is over? Is the Taliban in charge? And secondly, Congressman John Ratcliffe, why are you renominating him?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you considering sending more U.S. troops to Iraq? What would be the justification for it? And how reliable is this new timetable of 12 to 18 months?",
    "Q. And would you walk away?",
    "Q. Thank you, sir. Can you talk about your conversation with Pope Benedict earlier? Did you have a fundamental disagreement over whether Iraq was a just war? And what of his concerns about Iraq did you take to heart?And if I could, to the Prime Minister: What did you tell the President today about the trials going on here involving Americans?",
    "Q. And would you tell us what those are?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said this week that your microphone has never been louder on some of the key domestic priorities you've talked about, particularly Social Security and immigration. Your use of the Presidential microphone hasn't yielded the results that you wanted. So I'm wondering\u2014the Democratic Congress, at this point, Republicans no longer controlling things on Capitol Hill\u2014why you think your microphone is any louder, and how you plan to use it differently to get the results that you're looking for?",
    "Q. I get another one. [Laughter] This is a good deal. Can you tell us whether you think your personal relationship with the Democratic leaders in Congress has had a negative impact on your ability to get your legislation through? And how important is that personal relationship?",
    "Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I appreciate it. I'm\u2014I wanted to sort of address\u2014or ask about a tension that has sort of been in this\u2014in this press conference on unifying the country, because you campaigned on two things. One of them is being able to accomplish big things, and the other is the ability to unify the country. And even today you've talked about sort of a different posture with Republicans. And I wonder if you still think it's possible to do both of those things?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. My question is on Iraq. Mr. President, this morning you talked at length about Afghanistan, Iran, but not Iraq. And I wanted to ask both of you, is France reconciled with the United States as the United States is reconciled with France? So what about Iraq? Can France, for instance, help to get out of the Iraqi quagmire? And President Bush, where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq? Do you have a timetable for withdrawing troops?",
    "Q. You've agreed to talk to Syria in the context of the international conferences on Iraq. What's so different or wrong about Speaker Pelosi having her own meetings there? And are you worried that she might be preempting your own efforts?",
    "Q. Just to be clear, did you just say that the\u2014your strategy is to destroy ISIS or to simply contain them or push them back?",
    "Q. Why haven't we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that?",
    "Q. I have two really simple questions. I promise. You campaigned on canceling $10,000 in student loans. Do you still plan to do so and when?And then, my second question is: Now that you've clarified the Bull Connor comments, do you plan to reach out to Republicans like Mitt Romney to talk about reforming the Electoral Count Act?",
    "Q. Are you confident it will happen before the deadline?",
    "Q. What's your message for President Moon, who has effectively reached the glass ceiling, as far inter-Korean cooperation is concerned, due to sanctions? And what's next for U.S.-R.O.K. military drills?",
    "Q. President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?",
    "Q. Well, a couple years ago, Charles Krauthammer, columnist and Harvardtrained psychiatrist, coined a term, Bush derangement syndrome, to talk about your critics who disagreed with you most passionately, not just your policies, but seemed to take an animosity towards you. I'm just wondering, as you look back, why you think you engendered such passionate criticism, animosity, and do you have any message specifically to those\u2014to that particular part of the spectrum of your critics?",
    "Q. So you tweeted yesterday, What good is NATO? And you've talked about NATO as an alliance that benefits Europe\u2014that defends and protects Europe. Do you see any value of NATO to the United States vis-\u00e0-vis Russia? Does it help protect the United States from Russia, in your view?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said that Ukraine shouldn't enter NATO until after the war is over. Are you concerned at all that those comments could motivate Putin to keep the war going or discourage him from entering peace negotiations?And is there a serious risk that this war could drag on for years? And do you see any path toward the war ending with Putin still in power?",
    "Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I'd like to ask about two topics. First of all, what more specifically can the U.S. do to help Kenya in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still see Somalia as a counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about Kenyan authorities using counterterrorism as an excuse to commit human rights violations?Secondly, can you comment on the state of gay and lesbian\u2014the treatment of gay and lesbians in Kenya, which rights groups have called dismal and President Kenyatta has called a nonissue?For you, sir, President Kenyatta, on the same themes, what more do you need from the United States to help fight al-Shabaab, and are you getting it? And can you please also respond to criticism about the state of gay rights in your country?",
    "Q. Good morning, Your Excellencies. My question is to President Bush. Looking at Africa from afar, things might look bleak, but all may not be lost yet. A new Africa is emerging. But in your candid view, what do you think Africa must do, and what kind of leadership do you expect to see in Africa? And how will the U.S. help in this regard, to push forward the agenda to transform the continent into a better place for its people?And secondly, what do you hope to achieve from your five-nation tour, and why have you decided to visit Africa on the last lap of your term? And how do you want to ensure continuity in whatever you hope to achieve?",

    "Q. First of all, for you, Mr. President, the Saudis, in about 10 days, will be hosting a summit on oil prices and supplies. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said that he will go to this. With four-dollar-a-gallon gasoline back home, would you go?",
    "Q. The\u2014if I could follow up, sir: The South China Morning Post, the Beijing newspaper, says that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favorable to them. Is this something you'd be interested in doing?",

During the conventions, Kimberly and Don Jr. had the outreach\u2014the Indian American community\u2014with a video called Four More Years for you, which has gone viral among the Indian Americans in the battleground States.So my question is: Would Kimberly, Don Jr., and Ivanka Trump, who are very popular among Indian Americans\u2014would be campaigning on your behalf around the Indian Americans with your views on the India and U.S. relationship?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you've stressed over and over in recent days particularly the importance of FISA reform to help keep America safe, and yet you have not yet filled a key national security post. Fran Townsend announced her resignation months ago, in November. What is the delay there, and what are Americans to make of that delay? Is America less safe because of it?",

    "Q. Thank you, sir. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence will send a message that leaking classified material will not generate a tough sentence to groups like WikiLeaks? How do you reconcile that in light of WikiLeaks' connection to Russia's hacking in last year's election? And related to that, Julian Assange has now offered to come to the United States. Are you seeking that? And would he be charged or arrested if he came here?",
    "Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the prospect that your successor would be dealing with the war. You'll be making your first trip to Vietnam in roughly a week. Some people are still\u2014are looking at the war as another Vietnam war. Are they wrong to do so? And if so, why?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President, the best. [Laughter] Thank you very much for hosting us.

    "Q. Can I ask another question, sir, on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about Federal Government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases?",
    "Q. Took a kind of confrontational approach to him. You had brief discussions with him at APEC. How confrontational or not were those encounters? Did you have any further exchanges with him here? What, if any, projects\u2014progress did you make with him on the Ukraine issue? And of course, you've now just met with EU leaders. Did you agree on further sanctions?One other question, sir, on a domestic subject. Are you prepared to state unequivocally that if Congress does pass a Keystone pipeline bill, that you would veto it if it comes to your desk?",
    "Q. [Inaudible]\u2014Sankei Newspaper Company. I have a question to President Trump. You met with the family members of abductees, and you met with Hitomi Soga, actual abductee. How can you comment on your meeting with them? To North Korea, is there a possibility of U.S. military action? Suppose that the U.S. decides to go on it, the abductees' rescue, how do you think about it once the military action is to be imminent?",
    "Q. Some of your longtime advisers are leaving the White House, and new folks are coming in. Others are taking on new roles in the West Wing. As you reshape your team a bit, how does that change the dynamic here? And how does it impact what you think you can accomplish going forward?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned that the U.S. and its European allies have reached a consensus on extending the sanctions against Russia. Is there a consensus, though, about what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues to violate the Minsk agreement? And also if\u2014can you deter Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent U.S. troop presence?And separately, I wanted to ask you about the possibility that the court battle over your actions on immigration could extend late into your term. Do you think that there's anything more that you can do for the people who would have benefited from that program and now are in limbo? And how do you view the possibility of your term ending without accomplishing your goals on immigration?",

Do you agree with that assessment, that there were no threats or scare tactics?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've described the U.S. relationship with China as complex. U.S. military sources are now confirming that Chinese hackers hacked into the computers at the Pentagon in June, hackers linked to the Government in Beijing. And it's being described as a complicated cyber attack. Have you been briefed on this attack? How much more complex does this make the relationship with China?

Reports indicate that you may be trying to collect as much as $200 million. Is that figure accurate? Do you believe it's important for the American people to know who is giving that kind of money to their President? Will you disclose the contributions as they come in? And will you place any restriction on who gives money and how much they can give?",
    "Q. Good afternoon, gentlemen. For President Bush, how deep and how long will the economic recession be in the United States, and how will it affect Mexico?And what is your perspective, Mr. President, of the reform presented by President Calderon in Mexico?And for all three of you, what's the security context that exists with regard to what's happening to NAFTA and the FTA with Colombia after Colombia carried out a military invasion in Ecuador?",
    "Q. Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today?",
    "Q. Mr. President, it sounds like you're offering some way out here, some off-ramp. And it sounds like what it is, is\u2014at least in the informal assurance\u2014that NATO is not going to take in Ukraine anytime in the next few decades. And it sounds like you're saying we would never put nuclear weapons there. He also wants us to move all of our nuclear weapons out of Europe and not have troops rotating through the old Soviet bloc.Do you think there's space for there as well?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just spoke of the need for banks to start lending, you talked earlier about how creative they can be in chasing profit, and yet earlier in the week, you said that banks don't have some inherent right to just, you know, get a certain amount of profit. You also said in that interview that you can stop them. How do you plan on stopping them from charging this $5 fee or whatever the fee is? And do you think that your Government has a right to dictate how much profits American companies make?",
    "Q. How does it help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East, the deal today?",
    "Q. Thank you, gentlemen. I have one question for the two of you. Canada has announced it's pulling out in 2011; South Korea is already gone. In that context are you concerned about the level of international support for the war here, and are the 20,000 additional U.S. troops enough to bring this conflict to a close?",

    "Q. Yes, my name is Moon\u2014[inaudible]. I'm affiliated to Dong-A Ilbo Daily Newspaper. I have a question for President Moon: Between Korea and the United States, I think one of the most important diplomatic challenges would be to overcome\u2014to resolve the nuclear problem of the D.P.R.K. And you gave a foreign press interview; you talked about bringing balance and diplomacy, and you talked about resolving nuclear problem and the close cooperation between Korea and the United States, and you talked about the China's role.Are you referring to the balance between the U.S.\u2014balance of Korea between U.S. and China, or are you referring to something else? And you have had a third summit meeting at the summit meeting you just had. You said that you have agreed to bring permanent peace to\u2014[inaudible]\u2014on the Korean Peninsula. And what kind of role are you expecting the United States and President Trump to play with regards to settling peace on the Korean Peninsula?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to switch to Afghanistan. There was another attempt on President Karzai's life. There are operations going on there right now. Is the strategy succeeding? Are we winning in Afghanistan?",
    "Q. First, back to ISIS and Iraq and Syria, your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the 6 years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS?",
    "Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Afghanistan, you're seeking increased commitments from NATO. There are been\u2014have been some new pledges. Are they enough? How many figures\u2014how many troops are needed? Are you satisfied with the pledges, and what are the consequences if those pledges fall short?"
  ],
  "answer": [
    "Well, I think we have a lot of leverage. I think we have tremendous leverage. I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi\u2014a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot. You know, we're having very tough talks on trade. And I think that probably affects China somewhat. But I have to do what I have to do. And I think, over the last 2 months, the border is more open than it was when we first started. But that is what it is. We have to do it. We had a\u2014we have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit. We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it. We can't continue to let that happen.And I think that has had an impact on my relationship, in terms of the border. I don't think it has the relationship\u2014you know, I don't think it affects my feeling or my relationship to President Xi. But when we first started, we weren't ready to go that route. And as we started preparing and getting ready to do that, I think that's had an impact on, frankly, the border. I\u2014which is a shame. But I have to do it. I have no choice. For our country, I have to do it.South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done. And if that means we can't trade, well, then I'm not going to trade. They're definitely not going to trade. If they think\u2014and they would do this with our concurrence\u2014if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line\u2014we're actually very far. You know, that document, when you read it today, that's far down the line. That's not something that just happened to be put together. This was done over months. And again, the rhetoric was important, and the sanctions were important. I don't even know which one was more important. They were both important.Yes. Go ahead.",
    "I can't hear him. What?",
    "No, it'sbecause, first of all, I'm not a member of that party. [] Second of all, it didn't stop us from being the key leader in getting this done.I mean, this is something I've been working on now for 5, 6 years. When I went to Copenhagen, I essentially engaged in 24 hours of diplomacy to salvage from a pretty chaotic process the basic principle that all countries had to participate, that itwe couldn't have a rigid division between developed countries and developing countries when it came to solving this problem. That was the initial foundation for us then working with other countries, culminating in the joint announcement with China, bringing in India, bringing in Brazil and the other big, emerging countries, working with the Europeans, and getting this done.This would not have happened without American leadership. And by the way, the same is true for the Iran nuclear deal. The same is true for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The same is true for stamping out Ebola, something, you guys may recall from last year, which was the potential end of the world.At each juncture, what we've said is, is that American strength and American exceptionalism is not just a matter of us bombing somebody. More often, it's a matter of us convening, setting the agenda, pointing other nations in a direction that's good for everybody and good for U.S. interests, engaging in painstaking diplomacy, leading by example. And sometimes, the results don't come overnight, they don't come the following day, but they come.And this year, what you really saw was that steady, persistent leadership on aon many initiatives that I began when I first came into office.All right. I've got April Ryan [American Urban Radio Network].",
    "Okay. [] Excellent questions, Roberta. She doesn't sound Canadian. [] That was pretty mean. [] Canadians are a little more subtle. []I'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's\u2014I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just\u2014I'm helping them out a little bit. [] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.With respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.And so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics\u2014which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7\u00bd years that I've been President\u2014is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.With respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that that will be a difficult, challenging process, but it does not need to be a panicky process. I think it can be a steady, sensible process.Obviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that\u2014I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.And then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact\u2014and when in fact\u2014they leave.I have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting\u2014the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental\u2014that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.We are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.[.] One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.So when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.So as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today\u2014and I did not make reference to a specific place\u2014my words reinforce what I believe.I believe that in this global scenario\u2014and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question\u2014we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.And I just said it: What we have reached so far\u2014the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world\u2014without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society\u2014or the societies, at least, of our three countries\u2014had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past\u2014and President Obama already said it, even years back\u2014but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.That was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.[ spoke in English as follows.] [Inaudible]\u2014last question.[.]The question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.[.]",
    "We had an intensive conversation about it. If you're asking me whether they signed on to that proposition, I don't think it would be fair to say that they are there yet. But my--I'm going to keep on making the argument, and my expectation is, is that at some point there's a recognition that it's hard to envision a better future for Syria while Asad is still there.Julianna Goldman [Bloomberg News].",
    "Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worst recession since the Great Depression, and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going to melt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession. So let's be clear about the sources of uncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years: a huge contraction, trillions of dollars of losses in people's 401(k)s, people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that they still haven't worked out, the housing market losing a whole bunch of value.So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent, the economy is now growing by 6 percent. The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they're going to start hiring at a more rapid clip. What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel like Washington is working and able to get some things done.There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty. One way would be to say, well, you know what, we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets. We won't have the regulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of too big to fail. That will provide certainty, until the next financial crisis.That's not the kind of certainty, I think, that the financial markets need. The kind of certainty they need is for us to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers are protected in the financial markets, so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail, that we have ways of winding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts. That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better.The same would be true when it comes to health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, Boy, we'd like you to get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latest invoice for their premiums, and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent, that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment.So I guess my answer would be this: The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got our act together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be. I absolutely agree on that.What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business interests that got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if we just didn't try to regulate the banks. That, I think, would be a mistake. All right?",
    "We'll we're going to see, but we'll take care of States, because States are working very hard. We have hospitals in states that make rooms available, and they\u2014they're building quarantine areas\u2014areas where you can keep people safely. We're working really well with States. It's a very big part of it.So you know, my attitude: If Congress wants to give us the money so easy\u2014it wasn't very easy for the wall, but we got that one done. If they want to give us the money, we'll take the money. We'll just do a good job with it.Yes, please. Go ahead. Go ahead.",
    "I've got to be careful here, Major, because Mr. Snowden is under indictment; he's been charged with crimes. And that's the province of the Attorney General and ultimately a judge and a jury. So I can't weigh in specifically on this case at this point. I'll make\u2014I'll try to see if I can get at the spirit of the question, even if I can't talk about the specifics.I've said before and I believe that this is an important conversation that we needed to have. I've also said before that the way in which these disclosures happened have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.I'll give you just one specific example. The fact of the matter is that the United States, for all our warts, is a country that abides by rule of law, that cares deeply about privacy, that cares about civil liberties, that cares about our Constitution. And as a consequence of these disclosures, we've got countries who actually do the things that Mr. Snowden says he's worried about very explicitly\u2014engaging in surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, targeting and suppressing the press\u2014who somehow are able to sit on the sidelines and act as if it's the United States that has problems when it comes to surveillance and intelligence operations. And that's a pretty distorted view of what's going on out there.So I think that, as important and as necessary as this debate has been, it is also important to keep in mind that this has done unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy. But I will leave it up to the courts and the Attorney General to weigh in publicly on the specifics of Mr. Snowden's case.",

    "Okay, so, again, the hoax was used with respect to Democrats and what they were saying. It was a hoax, what they were saying. And that was very clear, if you'd read the words. And I think you know that too.As far as what responsibility: My great responsibility\u2014I think the biggest decision we made was going very early. And that was a decision made against a lot of people that thought we shouldn't do that. That's why we're at 22 instead of a much higher number. It would have been a much higher number. That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean, not even early or late. It had never been made, a decision like that. So that was big.And my next thing is really getting the best people. We have the best people in the world. They're standing behind me. These people are so talented. I've seen them in action now for a number of weeks, actually, but for\u2014in particular, for the last 4 or 5e days. And I want to thank Mike Pence and everybody for the job they're doing. We have a great team. We have great people. And this too will end.",
    "Well, I guess you could call getting the EU-3, China, and Russia on the same page on a Chapter VII resolution successful diplomacy. I thought that was diplomacy. And it took a long time to get there. I mean, we're working hard to send a concerted message to the ians, a focused, unified message that the world believes you should not have a nuclear program. And so this is a multilateral approach to try to get the Government to alter its course on a nuclear weapons program.I can't think of any more robust diplomacy than to have more than one party at the table talking to the ians. And we did so through the United Nations at this case. If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this weapons program that is causing such grave concern.We'll continue to work with other nations. Matter of fact, I believe that it is easier for the United States to achieve certain diplomatic objectives when we work with other nations, which is precisely why we adopted the strategy we did in dealing with the ians.Sheryl.",
    "I haven't seen the report that you just referred to. I do share concerns about ian intention to have a nuclear weapon. I firmly believe that if were to have a nuclear weapon, it would be a seriously destabilizing influence in the Middle East. And therefore, we have worked to build a international coalition to try to convince the ians to give up their weapon, to make it clear that they have choices to make\u2014whether the choice be isolation or missed opportunity to grow their economies. And so we take your\u2014 we take seriously the attempts of the ians to gain a nuclear weapon.",
    "I'm not entirely sure which direction your question was, but I can say one thing: When it comes to the state of our reconnaissance assets and the strategic assets\u2014on acquisition of these U.S. strategic assets\u2014we have agreed to begin the consultations for acquisition\u2014Korea's acquisition of such assets. And that is to enhance Korea's defense capabilities and also the combined defense posture of Korea and the United States. I think it is essential. . Margaret, if I may add to that, that the President and I have agreed they'll be buying a tremendous\u2014which they want, and which they need, and everybody thinks it makes a lot of sense. We make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's planes, whether it's missiles. No matter what it is, we have the greatest military equipment in the world. And South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense. And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.But they'll be ordering billions of dollars' worth of equipment, and we've already approved some of those orders. Okay? Thank you.",
    "Thanks. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children.And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the\u2014Ghana a better place.Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders\u2014I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we\u2014I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help.In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi.Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect.And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders.I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met\u2014not every single leader\u2014 but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy\u2014a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am here. It's been a great trip, and it's\u2014and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura.Let's see here, John McKinnon. He would be from your Wall Street Journal. Yes, that's a pretty sophisticated paper, no question about that.",
    "Let me talk more broadly, and then I'll talk specifically about the program you are referring to.As you know, the independent panel that I put together came back with a series of recommendations, 46 in total. I had an extensive meeting with them down in the Situation Room to review all the recommendations that they had made. I want to thank them publicly, because I think they did an excellent job and took my charge very seriously, which is, I told them, I want you to look from top to bottom at what we're doing and evaluate whether or not the current structures that we have and the current programs that we have are properly addressing both our continuing need to keep ourselves secure and to prevent terrorist attacks or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other threats to the homeland? And are we also making sure that we're taking seriously rule of law and our concerns about privacy and civil liberties?So what we're doing now is evaluating all the recommendations that have been made. Over the next several weeks, I'm going to assess based on conversations not just with the intelligence community, but others in Government and outside of Government, how we might apply and incorporate their recommendations. And I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about all of this in January, where I'll be able to say: here are the recommendations that we think make sense; here are ones that we think are promising, but still need to be refined further; here's how it relates to the work we're doing not just internally, but also in partnership with other countries. And so I'm taking this very seriously because I think, as I've said before, this is a debate that needed to be had.One specific program, the 215 program, is the metadata, the bulk collection of phone numbers and exchanges that have taken place, that has probably gotten the most attention, at least with respect to domestic audiences. And what I've said in the past continues to be the case, which is that the NSA, in executing this program, believed, based on experiences from 9/11, that it was important for us to be able to track if there was a phone number of a known terrorist outside of the United States calling into the United States, where that call might have gone, and that having that data in one place and retained for a certain period of time allowed them to be confident in pursuing various investigations of terrorist threats.And I think it's important to note that in all the reviews of this program that have been done, in fact, there have not been actual instances where it's been alleged that the NSA in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data. But what is also clear is, from the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility, of abuse. And I think that's what the judge and the district court suggested. And although his opinion obviously differs from rulings on the FISA Court, we're taking those into account.The question we're going to have to ask is, can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing? I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers, that we may have to refine this further to give people more confidence. And I'm going to be working very hard on doing that.And we've got to provide more confidence to the international community. In some ways, what has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the NSA and other intelligence agencies are not spying on Americans. We've had less legal constraint in terms of what we're doing internationally. But I think part of what's been interesting about this whole exercise is recognizing that in a virtual world, some of these boundaries don't matter anymore, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should. And the values that we've got as Americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders, I think, perhaps more systematically than we've done in the past.Okay?

    "Well, I think we're going to have to work with them, but\u2014just like I think we're going to have to work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. It's very important that the people understand the consequences of failure. And I have vowed to the country that we're not going to fail. We're not going to leave before the job is done. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with some Members of Congress. I don't know how many Members of Congress said, Get out right now\u2014 I mean, the candidates running for Congress in the Senate. I haven't seen that chart. Some of the comments I read where they said, Well, look, we just need a different approach to make sure we succeed\u2014well, you can find common ground there.See, if the goal is success, then we can work together. If the goal is, get out now regardless, then that's going to be hard to work together. But I believe the Democrats want to work together to win this aspect of the war on terror.I'm also looking forward to working with them to make sure that we institutionalize, to the extent possible, steps necessary to make sure future Presidents are capable of waging this war. Because Iraq is a part of the war on terror, and it's\u2014I think back to Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. I mean, Harry Truman began the cold war, and Eisenhower, obviously, from a different party, continued it. And I would hope that would be the spirit that we're able to work together. We may not agree with every tactic, but we should agree that this country needs to secure ourselves against an enemy that would like to strike us again. This enemy is not going away after my Presidency.And I look forward to working with them. And I truly believe that Congresswoman Pelosi and Harry Reid care just about as much\u2014they care about the security of this country, like I do. They see the\u2014no leader in Washington is going to walk away from protecting the country. We have different views on how to do that, but their spirit is such that they want to protect America. That's what I believe.Just like I talked about the troops\u2014I meant what I said. Look, the people that's\u2014are going to be looking at this election\u2014the enemy is going to say, Well, it must mean America is going to leave. And the answer is, no, that doesn't\u2014what it means. Our troops are wondering whether or not they're going to get the support they need after this election. Democrats are going to support our troops just like Republicans will. And the Iraqis have got to understand, this election\u2014as I said, don't be fearful. In other words, don't look at the results of the elections and say, Oh, no. America is going to leave us before the job is complete. That's not what's going to happen, Jim.Yes, sir, Fletcher [Michael Fletcher, Washington Post].",

So I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance.As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes.

    "Ed, going into Iraq, we were warned about a lot of things, some of which happened, some of which didn't happen. And obviously, as I made a decision of\u2014as consequential as that, I weighed the risks and rewards of any decision. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I know the Iraqis are better off without Saddam Hussein in power. I think America is safer without Saddam Hussein in power.As to Al Qaida in Iraq, Al Qaida is going to fight us wherever we are. See, that's their strategy. Their strategy is to drive us out of the Middle East. They have made it abundantly clear what they want. They want to establish a caliphate. They want to spread their ideology. And they want safe haven from which to launch attacks. They're willing to kill the innocent to achieve their objectives, and they will fight us. And the fundamental question is, will we fight them? I have made the decision to do so. I believe that the best way to protect us in this war on terror is to fight them.And so we're fighting them in Iraq; we're fighting them in Afghanistan; we've helped the Philippines fight\u2014Philippine Government fight them. We're fighting them. And this notion about how this isn't a war on terror, in my view, is naive. It doesn't reflect the true nature of the world in which we live.You know, the lessons of September the 11th are these: We've got to stay on the offense; we've got to bring these people to justice before they hurt again; and, at the same time, defeat their ideology with a ideology based upon liberty. And that's what you're seeing, and they're resisting it.I think it ought to be illustrative to the American people that Al Qaida is trying to stop new democracies from evolving. And what does\u2014what should that tell you? That ought to tell you that we're dealing with people that have an ideology that is opposite of liberty and will take whatever measures are necessary to prevent this young democracy from succeeding.The danger in this particular theater in the war on terror is that if we were to fail, they'd come and get us. And, you know, I look at these reports right here in the Oval Office. For people who say that we're not under threat, they just simply do not know the world. We are under threat.

    "First of all, I\u2014we're not in a recession, we're in a slowdown. We grew in the fourth quarter of last year. We haven't had first-quarter growth statistics yet, but there's no question, we're in a slowdown. And yes, people are concerned about it, obviously. I'm\u2014of all the three of us standing up here, I'm probably the most concerned about the slowdown. After all, it's affecting the people who I have the honor of representing.That's why we passed, in working with the Congress, a significant progrowth economic package that will pass back rebates to our citizens, starting in the second week of May. Part of that package also included incentives for large and small businesses to invest in the year 2008. I think this is going to have a positive effect on the economy. Experts say it's going to have a positive effect on the economy. And so we'll see what happens there. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes during this period of time and send a signal that they're not going to raise taxes.You know, the President is plenty capable of handling reform. She's a\u2014he's a good, honest man who cares deeply about the people of Mexico. And he'll do what he thinks is right for the country of Mexico.And in terms of President Uribe, we got no better friend in South America than President Uribe. He believes strongly in rule of law. He's a reformer, and he's working hard to protect his country from a bunch of narcotraffickers who murder innocent people to achieve their objectives. And he ought to have our support. He has the support of the United States of America in many ways, but if we don't agree to a free trade agreement that we honest\u2014 negotiated in good faith with them, it will undermine his efforts, and it will destabilize parts of the world. And it would be a big mistake for the Congress to turn its back on Colombia. I simply want to stress the measures Mexico is adopting before this situation\u2014this slowdown of economic growth in the United States, which obviously affects us. More than 82 percent of our exports go to the United States, and we're adopting a number of measures. One of them is a very aggressive program for public expenditure and infrastructure, not just private spending. To give you an idea, Mexico is going from spending 3 percentage points of the GDP per year on infrastructure to over 51\u20442 percent of the GDP on infrastructure.We're talking about Mexico this year having expenses for infrastructural programs of about $500 billion for private-public programs. That's already showing up in the figures of the first quarter of the year.We're also working on an anticyclic program with very aggressive tax stimulus package for investment in the poorest regions of Mexico, where whoever invests there will get a 100-percent deduction on all investments, and the Federal Government, for a year and a half, will pay all expenses associated with social security, with labor\u2014all the labor costs associated with social security. And that's a very, very strong stimulus package.The first data coming in indicates that for Mexico, our economic activity had 4.25percent growth rate per year. The figures for February and March indicate that industrial activity continues to show about 4 percent growth. So it's a difficult time because of the enormous interconnection among our economies, but we are prepared to face the situation and at a slower place than the one we've had in the past. But we are dealing with the situation. We are moving with everything at the Government's disposal to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy.I hope that this situation will not continue for very long and that soon the authorities in the United States will be able to completely overcome the situation. I think that the steps taken so far by the fiscal tax monetary authorities in the United States and the Bush administration\u2014and in general\u2014have been appropriate. They have been the right measures, and we hope that they will very soon demonstrate effects so that we have a quick recovery among all our economies. I would just say that in spite of a slowdown of the economy in Canada, the bases of our economy are stable and solid. And we have undertaken measures to ensure the continuous growth in the future.Now, as far as the Colombia situation is concerned, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with Colombia. And it's important also for the United States and for Mexico to benefit from free trade Colombia.Last year, in the summit, I said that Colombia can have drug trafficking with our countries without a free trade agreement, but if you want legitimate business for all our economies, we need to pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. And I said in New York a few months ago that I worry if the United States in the end refuses this agreement with Colombia.We have important alliance in Colombia. Colombia is fighting against political violence, against the FARC. They fight against drug traffickers. And I think that a rejection of or turning our backs to such an ally as Colombia is\u2014could create long-term problems for our countries in South America.[]\u2014\u2014free trade agreement to have drug trade with Colombia. You're going to have that anyway. If you want to have legitimate trade and see that country progress economically, we need to have a free trade agreement. We need to have a trade agreement with countries like Colombia.And I do worry that if the Colombian free trade agreement is rejected, particularly when that country has taken a lot of efforts to fight political violence and corruption and FARC and drug traffickers, if the United States and our allies turn their back on an important ally in this region, that that will have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. So that does worry the Government of Canada.",
    "Well, I think we've got to let the science guide us. And I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful. What we do know is that the Ebola virus, both currently and in the past, is controllable if you have a strong public health infrastructure in place.And the countries that have been affected are the first to admit that what's happened here is, is that their public health systems have been overwhelmed. They weren't able to identify and then isolate cases quickly enough. You did not have a strong trust relationship between some of the communities that were affected and public health workers. As a consequence, it spread more rapidly than has been typical with the periodic Ebola outbreaks that have occurred previously.But despite obviously the extraordinary pain and hardship of the families and persons who've been affected, and despite the fact that we have to take this very seriously, it is important to remind ourselves, this is not an airborne disease; this is one that can be controlled and contained very effectively if we use the right protocols.So what we've done is to make sure that we're surging not just U.S. resources, but we've reached out to European partners and partners from other countries, working with the WHO. Let's get all the health workers that we need on the ground. Let's help to bolster the systems that they already have in place. Let's nip as early as possible any additional outbreaks of the disease. And then during the course of that process, I think it's entirely appropriate for us to see if there are additional drugs or medical treatments that can improve the survivability of what is a very deadly and obviously brutal disease.So we're going to\u2014we're focusing on the public health approach right now because we know how to do that. But I will continue to seek information about what we're learning with respect to these drugs going forward.",
    "Regarding the coalition of the international community, I believe that the resolution approved by all at the Security Council enabled us to say that now the entire world is committed to fighting against Daesh Then\u2014and this is what I will check when I travel to Moscow\u2014we need one single goal; that is, to tackle terrorism and fight against Daesh militarily And I believe that we can have some further cooperation and coordination militarily to do moreAt the same time, we have to be clear when it comes to the political solution, the one that will enable us to find an outcome for Syria And in this respect, like we've said, and\u2014but we can repeat it, Bashar al-Asad cannot be the future of SyriaIn Vienna, we are already working with all of the countries, even though they do not necessarily\u2014they do not have the same stance: Turkey, Iran, Gulf countries, the United States, France, and of course, all of those who are meant to find a solution But we must work on that transition, a transition where Bashar al-Asad plays no role Because he's been the problem, so he cannot be the solution Just to comment very quickly, we've got a coalition of 65 countries who have been active in pushing back against ISIL for quite some time France has been a central part of that coalition, as have European countries, Arab countries Countries as far flung as Australia and countries in Southeast Asia are part of that coalitionRussia right now is a coalition of two, Iran and Russia, supporting Asad Given Russia's military capabilities and given the influence they have on the Asad regime, them cooperating would be enormously helpful in bringing about a resolution of the civil war in Syria and allow us all to refocus our attention on ISILBut I think it's important for\u2014to remember that you've got a global coalition organized Russia is the outlier We hope that they refocus their attention on what is the most substantial threat and that they serve as a constructive partner And if and when they do, it will make it easier for us to go after ISIL and DaeshAlthough I think it's also important to recognize that the kinds of airstrikes that they're carrying out\u2014just like the kinds of airstrikes that we're carrying out\u2014in and of themselves are not sufficient And the work that we do to bolster local fighting forces, the cutting off of supply lines, financing, oil, reducing the flow of foreign fighters, the intelligence work that needs to be done\u2014all of that is something that we are doing now and that they can supplementBut that's going to be a process that involves hard, methodical work It's not going to be something that happens just because suddenly we take a few more airstrikes And that's the kind of hard work that I know France is prepared to do, the United States is prepared to do, and perhaps, in the future, Russia will be as well Okay?Thank you very much, everybody",
    "Well, keep in mind that the Russian Army is a lot bigger than the Ukrainian Army. So the issue here is not whether the Ukrainian Army has some additional weaponry. At least up until this point, they've been fighting a group of separatists who have engaged in some terrible violence, but who can't match the Ukrainian Army.Now, if you start seeing an invasion by Russia, that's obviously a different set of questions. We're not there yet. What we have been doing is providing a whole host of assistance packages to the Ukrainian Government and to their military, and we will continue to work with them to evaluate on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis what exactly they need in order to be able to defend their country and to deal with the separatist elements that currently are being armed by Russia.But the best thing we can do for Ukraine is to try to get back on a political track.David Ohito, the Standard.",

They could've made it 2 days later or next week, and it would've been even better. They would've had more time.But having it during this very important summit is sort of incredible. And he lied a lot, but it was very interesting, because he didn't lie about one thing. He said no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't just lie about that, too, like he did about everything else?I mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn't say, Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that. He didn't say that. He said, No collusion. And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly. Could've\u2014he could've gone all out.

    "You know, the plans of Mr. Zarqawi was to foment sectarian violence. That's what he said he wanted to do. The Samarra bombing that took place last winter was intended to create sectarian violence, and it has. The recent bombings were to perpetuate the sectarian violence. In other words, we've been in this phase for a while. And the fundamental objective is to work with the Iraqis to create conditions so that the vast majority of the people will be able to see that there's a peaceful way forward.The bombings that took place recently was a part of a pattern that has been going on for about 9 months. I'm going to bring this subject up, of course, with Prime Minister Maliki when I visit with him in Jordan on Thursday. My questions to him will be: What do we need to do to succeed? What is your strategy in dealing with the sectarian violence? I will assure him that we will continue to pursue Al Qaida to make sure that they are unable to establish a safe haven in Iraq.I will ask him, What is required and what is your strategy to be a country which can govern itself and sustain itself?

    "Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we're apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that's consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that's consistent with rule of law.And frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be some times where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies--Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations--to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with.And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that's always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions.But I think it's important to understand, and the American people need to be assured, that any time we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we're able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you're suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay?Mike Emanuel, FOX.",
    "Well, I think we've got to let the science guide us. And I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful. What we do know is that the Ebola virus, both currently and in the past, is controllable if you have a strong public health infrastructure in place.And the countries that have been affected are the first to admit that what's happened here is, is that their public health systems have been overwhelmed. They weren't able to identify and then isolate cases quickly enough. You did not have a strong trust relationship between some of the communities that were affected and public health workers.

    "No, I strongly support a lighter, agile Army that can move quickly to meet the threats of the 21st century. I also supported his force posture review and recommendations to move forces out of previous bases that\u2014you know, they were there for the Soviet threat, for example, in Europe. So he's introduced some substantive changes to the Pentagon, and I support them strongly.However, that doesn't necessarily preclude increasing end strength for the Army and the Marines. And the reason why I'm inclined to believe this is a good idea is because I understand that we're going to be in a long struggle against radicals and extremists, and we must make sure that our military has the capability to stay in the fight for a long period of time. I'm not predicting any particular theater, but I am predicting that it's going to take a while for the ideology of liberty to finally triumph over the ideology of hate.I know you know I feel this strongly, but I see this\u2014we're in the beginning of a conflict between competing ideologies, a conflict that will determine whether or not your children can live in peace. A failure in the Middle East, for example, or failure in Iraq or isolationism will condemn a generation of young Americans to permanent threat from overseas. And therefore, we will succeed in Iraq. And therefore, we will help young democracies when we find them\u2014democracies like Lebanon, hopefully a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel, the young democracy of Iraq.It is in our interest that we combine security with a political process that frees people, that liberates people, that gives people a chance to determine their own futures.

    "Well, a number of things. First of all, Black unemployment is almost cut in half under my administration just since I began. More Black businesses have opened up\u2014small businesses\u2014than ever before.We're now in a situation where we're providing, through the Small Business Administration, downpayments for people buying homes, because most people accumulate wealth in the value of their home, most middle class families like mine. My dad bought a home, didn't have\u2014just scraped together to get a home. By the time he was able to retire, he was\u2014he had built up equity in a home. That's how most people do that.And so\u2014but what I can't do is, I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to get rid of inflation, but I do think we can. We brought\u2014we've already brought down the price of gasoline about $1.20 a gallon across the board. And I think that the oil companies are really doing the Nation a real disservice. They've made\u2014six of them made over $100 billion in the last quarter in profit. A hundred billion dollars.In the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before\u2014one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that\u2014you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to sell\u2014than they are selling it now, not taking advantage. And that lowers the price of the total gallon of gas because that gets passed on.So there's a whole lot of things that we can do that are difficult to do, but we're going to continue to push to do them.And the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and the average Black community. One, prescription drug costs. Well, we're driving those down precipitously, beginning next year.And you know, I'll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we're going to reduce that cost. They're not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of four\u2014average of $400.And I can go down the list of the things that\u2014my dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for, from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it's done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community and the poor\u2014and poorer communities. They need help.And so we're driving down all of those costs. And we've already passed the legislation to do that; it's just taking effect. So there's a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.And so\u2014but I am optimistic, because we continue to grow and at a rational pace, we're not anywhere near a recession right now, in terms of the growth. But I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing. I'm convinced that we're going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they, in fact, end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.",
    "Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.And this is not just my opinion. I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and prominent Republicans like John McCain. And the question, I think, that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? This isn't a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making. There has to be a point in which you say, this is not somebody I can support for President of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.And the fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity. I don't doubt that they were outraged about some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family. But there has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.Because a lot of people depend on the White House getting stuff right, and this is different than just having policy disagreements. Now, I recognize that they all profoundly disagree with myself or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or on certain elements of foreign policy. But there have been Republican Presidents with whom I disagreed with, but I didn't have a doubt that they could function as President. I think I was right and Mitt Romney and John McCain were wrong on certain policy issues, but I never thought that they couldn't do the job. And had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said to all Americans, they are\u2014this is our President, and I know they're going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense, will observe basic decency, will have enough knowledge about economic policy and foreign policy and our constitutional traditions and rule of law that our Government will work, and then we'll compete 4 years from now to try to win an election.But that's not the situation here. And that's not just my opinion; that is the opinion of many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough. And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump. And as I said in my speech last week, I don't think that actually represents the views of a whole lot of Republicans out there.With respect to Libya, I have said on several occasions that we did the right thing in preventing what could have been a massacre, a blood bath in Libya. And we did so as part of an international coalition and under U.N. mandate. But I think that all of us, collectively, were not sufficiently attentive to what had to happen the day after and the day after and the day after that, in order to ensure that there were strong structures in place to assure basic security and peace inside of Libya.The good news is, is that we now have the beginnings of a government in the Government of National Accord. They are serious about trying to bring all the factions together to start creating a basic security structure to begin to monitor Libya's borders and to cooperate internationally to deal with issues like ISIL penetration on their territory. And at the request of that Government, after they had already made significant progress against ISIL and had essentially pushed ISIL into a very confined area in and around Sirte, it is in America's national security interests in our fight against ISIL to make sure that they're able to finish the job. And so we're working in partnership with them to assure that ISIL does not get a stronghold in Libya, even as Libya begins what is going to be a long process to establish a functioning government and security system there.So the good news is that they recognize these\u2014this terrorist organization in their midst is contrary to their national interests, as well as the world's. And we're hopeful that having completed this process of driving ISIL out, they will then be in a position to start bringing the parties together inside that country. And not only us, but the Europeans and other countries around the world have a great interest in seeing stability in Libya, because that\u2014the absence of stability has helped to fuel some of the challenges that we've seen in terms of the migration crisis in Europe and some of the humanitarian tragedies that we've seen in the open seas between Libya and Europe.

And in a war against extremists and radicals like these, we ought to be listening carefully to what they say. We ought to take their words seriously.

    "Well, Stephen, I think that we have both a moral obligation and a national security interest in, A, ending the slaughter in Syria, but, B, also ensuring that we've got a stable Syria that is representative of all the Syrian people and is not creating chaos for its neighbors. And that's why for the last 2 years, we have been active in trying to ensure that Bashar Asad exits the stage and that we can begin a political transition process.That's the reason why we've invested so much in humanitarian aid. That's the reason why we are so invested in helping the opposition and why we've mobilized the international community to isolate Syria. That's why we are now providing nonlethal assistance to the opposition, and that's why we're going to continue to do the work that we need to do.And in terms of the costs and the benefits, I think there'd be severe costs in doing nothing. That's why we're not doing nothing. That's why we are actively invested in the process. If what you're asking is, are there continuing reevaluations about what we do, what actions we take in conjunction with other international partners to optimize the day when\u2014or to hasten the day when we can see a better situation in Syria, we've been doing that all along and we'll continue to do that.I think that, understandably, there is a desire for easy answers. That's not the situation there. And my job is to constantly measure our very real and legitimate humanitarian and national security interests in Syria, but measuring those against my bottom line, which is what's in the best interest of America's security and making sure that I'm making decisions not based on a hope and a prayer, but on hard-headed analysis in terms of what will actually make us safer and stabilize the region.I would note\u2014not to answer the question that you lobbed over to \u2014that you suggested even in your question a perceived crossing of a red line. The operative word there, I guess, Stephen, is perceived. And what I've said is that we have evidence that there has been the use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, but I don't make decisions based on perceived. And I can't organize international coalitions around perceived. We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well.So we want to make sure that we have the best analysis possible. We want to make sure that we are acting deliberately. But I would just point out that there have been several instances during the course of my Presidency where I said I was going to do something, and it ended up getting done. And there were times when there were folks on the sidelines wondering why hasn't it happened yet and what's going on and why didn't it go on tomorrow? But in the end, whether it's bin Laden or Qaddafi, if we say we're taking a position, I would think at this point the international community has a pretty good sense that we typically follow through on our commitments. . With regard to actions towards Syria, what kind of message would that communicate to North Korea? That was the question. And recently, North Korea seems to be deescalating its threats and provocations. What seems to be behind that? You asked these two questions. In fact, North Korea is isolated at the moment, so it's hard to find anyone that could really accurately fathom the situation in North Korea. Its actions are all so very unpredictable. Hence, whether the Syrian situation would have an impact is hard to say for sure.Why is North Korea appearing to deescalate its threats and provocations? There's no knowing for sure. But what is clear and what I believe for sure is that the international community with regard to North Korea's bad behavior, its provocations, must speak with one voice, a firm message, and consistently send a firm message that they will not stand and that North Korea's actions in breach of international norms will be met with so-and-so sanctions and measures by the international community. At the same time, if it goes along the right way, there will be so-and-so reward. So if we consistently send that message to North Korea, I feel that North Korea will be left with no choice but to change.And instead of just hoping to see North Korea change, the international community must also consistently send that message with one voice to tell them and communicate to them that they have no choice but to change and to shape an environment where they are left with no choice but to make the strategic decision to change. And I think that's the effective and important way.",
    "I have a flat assurance from the\u2014from Zelenskyy that they will not\u2014they will not use it to go on and move into Russian geographic territory. But wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine in the area, they would be able to do that.Thank you all very, very much. Appreciate it.",
    "First of all, I absolutely would save Mr. Putin if he were drowning. I'd like to think that if anybody is out there drowning, I'm going to save them. I used to be a pretty good swimmer. I grew up in Hawaii. [] A little out of practice.Keep in mind that, when I came into office, the idea of reset was a recognition that there were a range of issues in which U.S. and Russian interests converged. It was in our national security interests to try to foster cooperation with the Russians so that, for example, we could have alternative supply lines to our troops in Afghanistan; so that we could obtain cooperation from Russia in applying sanctions to Iran and forcing them to the table to see if we could resolve that issue peacefully. And in fact, during the first term of my administration, the approach we took resulted in concrete benefits to the national security posture of the United States. We were able to reduce weapons of mass destruction. We were able to make sure that our troops were adequately supplied in Afghanistan at times, as you'll recall, when there were some tensions within Pakistan after we conducted the raid against bin Laden in Abbottabad. We were able to bring Iran to the table, and we now have what so far, at least, have been constructive discussions about resolving the nuclear problem there.So those were all things that were good for us, and I believe they were actually good for the Russians as well. Mr. Putin, in my second term, has had an increasing tendency to view the world through a cold war prism and to see Russia's interests as invariably in conflict with the West's. I disagree with him in my assessment of what's in Russia's interests, but he's the President of that country. There are still areas that we should be cooperating\u2014on counterterrorism, for example. But his decisions recently\u2014first, with respect to supporting the horrendous bloodshed carried out by the Asad regime in Syria, and then, most clearly, with respect to the situation in Ukraine\u2014makes it much more difficult for us to cooperate. And I suspect that that's going to linger for some time to come.We'll continue to look for areas where, if it's in our national security interests, and they think it's in their interests, that we'll try to find areas where we can work together. But the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine is a principle that the United States has to stand up to.Now, with respect to the impact of sanctions, Russia has a deep interest in what happens in Ukraine, and I think they're going about meeting those interests in entirely the wrong way. But what's clear is\u2014you're right\u2014Mr. Putin is going to make decisions based on what he thinks is best for Russia, and he views Ukraine as absolutely central, critical to his foreign policy and the long-term strategic interests of Russia.That doesn't mean that he doesn't take into account other long-term interests of Russia. Tens of billions of dollars of capital fleeing Russia poses a problem for Russia's long-term interests. Russia being isolated so that no business man or woman with any sense are going to want to invest there. That's a problem for Russia's long-term interests. And President Putin is not a stupid man and, I think, recently acknowledged that this has already had an impact. And certainly if the situation gets worse and sanctions are broadened to an entire sector, that will have a more severe impact on the Russian people and the Russian economy.And so there's going to come a point at which he's got to make a fundamental decision. Is he willing to see the Russian economy that was already weakened, that was already faltering, weaken further because he's unwilling to deal with Ukraine in a diplomatic fashion that respects their sovereignty, but still meets any legitimate interest that Russia may have? Or is he going to use military force and the kind of destabilizing activities that we've seen so far? That's a choice that he's going to have to make. But we shouldn't make the choice easy for him. He should recognize that the international community as a whole is not going to encourage the kinds of actions that he's taken so far.",
    "Absolutely, it's my job. I'm the President. And I think this has to get done. Just a broader point: If somebody told you that there is a plan out there that is guaranteed to double your health care costs over the next 10 years, that's guaranteed to result in more Americans losing their health care, and that is by far the biggest contributor to our Federal deficit, I think most people would be opposed to that. Well, that's the status quo. That's what we have right now.So if we don't change, we can't expect a different result. And that's why I think this is so important, not only for those families out there who are struggling and who need some protection from abuses in the insurance industry or need some protection from skyrocketing costs, but it's also important for our economy.And by the way, it's important for families' wages and incomes. One of the things that doesn't get talked about is the fact that when premiums are going up and the costs to employers are going up, that's money that could be going into people's wages and incomes. And over the last decade, we basically saw middle class families\u2014their incomes and wages flatlined. Part of the reason is because health care costs are gobbling that up.And that's why I say, if we can\u2014even if we don't reduce our health care costs by the $6,000 that we're paying more than any other country on Earth, if we just reduced it by two or three thousand, that would mean money in people's pockets. And that's possible to do. But we're going to have to make some changes. We've got to change how health care is delivered to doctors\u2014the health care delivery system works so that doctors are being paid for the quality of care and not the quantity of care. We've got to make information technology more effective. We've got to have the medical system work in teams so that people don't go through five different tests. Those are all critical to do, and we can do them.Now, I understand that people are feeling uncertain about this, they feel anxious, partly because we've just become so cynical about what government can accomplish, that people's attitudes are, you know, even though I don't like this devil, at least I know it, and I like that more than the devil I don't know. So folks are skeptical, and that is entirely legitimate because they haven't seen a lot of laws coming out of Washington lately that help them.But my hope is, and I'm confident that, when people look at the costs of doing nothing, they're going to say, we can make this happen. We've made big changes before that end up resulting in a better life for the American people.David Alexander of Reuters.",

    "[] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.With regard to\u2014I always found\u2014and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know\u2014but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other.

We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one.

There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[]\u2014with him about our concerns.

And we'll let the economists define it for what it is. I would hope that those who worry about recession, slowdown\u2014 whatever you want to call it\u2014make the tax cuts permanent as a way of helping to address this issue. Because if you're somebody out there trying to plan your future and you're worried about the future and you think your taxes are going to go up, it's going to cause different behavioral patterns.Secondly, I do want to thank the Members of Congress. And the man you talked to is a leader and did a very good job of helping shepherd through this billionsof-dollar package that is now beginning to hit America's pocketbooks. And we'll see how that goes. I hope it's as stimulative as we think it will be. But you can tell the good man you talked to, who is a good guy, that I fully understand that people are concerned. And they're concerned about high gasoline prices. They're worried about high food prices, worried about staying in their homes.The new issue, of course, is student loans. The House of Representatives passed a bill that\u2014sponsored by Mr. Miller, George Miller, that is a\u2014that we think can do the job. I hope the Senate moves a version of it very quickly so that we can help address this issue. I mean, one of the things that Government can do is either create more anxiety or less. And if you think your taxes are going to go up, that's going to make you anxious. If you think the Government is going to step in with a good policy that will help your child get a student loan, that will make you less anxious.One of the things we've done on home-ownership is the HOPE NOW Alliance, which, hopefully, makes people less anxious. Hopefully, it helps\u2014has kind of brought some sense of not only concern but action into the marketplace.

    "It's not quite accurate to say that the U.S. Government offered a no-spy agreement and then withdrew it. I think that what is accurate to say is, is that we do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country, with any of our closest partners. What we do have are a series of partnerships and procedures and processes that are built up between the various intelligence agencies.And what we are doing with the Germans\u2014as we're doing with the French, as we do with the British or the Canadians or anybody\u2014is to work through what exactly the rules are governing the relationship between each country and make sure that there are no misunderstandings. And I think that we have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there are still some gaps that need to be worked through.But I think what we can be confident about is that the basic approach that we take with Germany is similar to the approach that we take with all our allies and all our friends and that during the course of the last several years as technology advanced, I think there was a danger in which traditional expectations tipped over because of new technologies. And what we've tried to do is make sure that our policies now reflect increased capabilities and, as a consequence, increased dangers of intrusions in privacy.But let me put it this way: Our interest in working effectively with the Germans and to making sure that German governments as well as the German people feel confident about what we do is as important to us as any other country. Germany is at the top of our list in terms of friends and allies and colleagues, and so we're not holding back from doing something with Germany that we somehow do with somebody else. I think the whole debate, Mr.\u2014[inaudible]\u2014has shown that the situation is such that we have a few difficulties yet to overcome. So this is why there's going to be this cyber dialogue between our two countries, and this is also why there needs to be and will have to be more than just business as usual. I mean, looking at the discussion not only in the German Parliament, but also among members of the German Government and also in the German public, we need to do that.But it's very good that we have taken these first steps, and what's still dividing us\u2014issues, for example, of proportionality, and the like\u2014will be addressed. We will work on this, and it's going to be on the agenda for the next few weeks to come. Thank you very much, everybody.",
    "The process is not something that we discussed between ourselves during the summit meeting. In fact, when I was staying in Washington, DC, I had an interview with one of the newspapers there, and it came up. Of course, it was not a sudden suggestion. I did have a meeting among my staff and related ministries, and I talked about this in detail before I came to the United States.We have a new administration in Korea, and we haven't yet to begun dialogue with the ns. Inter-Korean dialogue, there is a need for us to have dialogue all the time. Up until now, we had dialogues whenever the need arose, and then it would stop. However, dialogue should be based on genuine cooperation and sincerity. And so with this in mind, I thought that it would be helpful to set up a permanent liaison office in both Seoul and Pyongyang.As for the summit meeting between myself and Chairman Kim, I will agree to it when the need is real. And I already said publicly that I am willing to meet with him\u2014not just once, but many times\u2014but if the meeting will yield substantial and real results. I believe only when that is possible, I am ready to meet with him and have sincere dialogue, because that will help to bring about peace and stability of the peninsula.So basically, I do hold that thought, but I'm not suggesting that\u2014to have a meeting with Chairman Kim anytime soon. If the need arises, again, I'm ready to meet with him. Steven Lee [Steven Lee Myers, New York Times].",
    "Well look, Chuck, there arethere's a pretty straightforward way of doing this, and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills, and then we have a vigorous debate about how we're going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way.Now, keep in mind that what we've heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they're able to push through andin order to replace the automatic spending cuts of the sequesterthat's $1.2 trillion. Say it takes another trillion or trillion-two to get us through one more year, they'd have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year2.5 trillion.They can't evenCongress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they're happy with. Because these same Republicans say they don't want to cut defense; they've claimed that they don't want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable. But the truth of the matter is, is that you can't meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare or having an impact on Medicaid or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn't add up.Now, whathere's what would work. What would work would be for us to say we've already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we won't be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion. The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more. The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before webefore the new year would achieve that. We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number.So if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if that's the conversation we're having, I'm happy to have that conversation. And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reformwhich, Speaker Boehner has acknowledged, can raise money in a sensible wayand by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package that gets this thing done.I'm happy to have that conversation. What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people: the threat that unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid or otherwise slash things that the American people don't believe should be slashed, that we're going to threaten to wreck the entire economy. That is not how, historically, this has been done. That's not how we're going to do it this time.",
    "I'm not being told any specific time. They've been there a long time, between him and his predecessor. At some point, I would imagine, things will change.

But we haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know. We've done, I would say, right down the middle. But we can go a lot tougher if we need to do that.But it's a very sad thing, and we're not looking for anything other than taking care of a lot of people that are starving and dying in the streets.

    "We had an extensive discussion of the situation in the euro zone, and obviously, everybody is keenly interested in getting that issue resolved.I'm not going to speculate on what happens if the Greek choose to exit because they've got an election and this is going to be an important debate inside of Greece. Everybody who was involved in the G-8 summit indicated their desire to see Greece stay in the euro zone in a way that's consistent with the commitments that it's already--that have already been made. And I think it's important for Greece, which is a democracy, to work through what their options are at a time of great difficulty.I think we all understand, though, what's at stake. What happens in Greece has an impact here in the United States. Businesses are more hesitant to invest if they see a lot of uncertainty looming across the Atlantic because they're not sure whether that's going to mean a further global slowdown. And we're already seeing very slow growth rates and in fact contraction in a lot of countries in Europe. So we had an extensive discussion about how do we strengthen the European project, generally, in a way that does not harm world economic growth, but instead moves it forward.And I've been clear, I think, in--not just this week, but over the last 2 years about what I think needs to be done. We've got to put in place firewalls that ensure that countries outside of Greece that are doing the right thing aren't harmed just because markets are skittish and nervous.We've got to make sure that banks are recapitalized in Europe so that investors have confidence. And we've got to make sure that there is a growth strategy to go alongside the need for fiscal discipline, as well as a monetary policy that is promoting the capacity of countries--like a Spain or an Italy--that have put in place some very tough targets and some very tough policies to also offer their constituencies a prospect for the economy improving, job growth increasing, incomes expanding, even if it may take a little bit of time.And the good news was, you saw a consensus across the board, from newly elected President Hollande to Chancellor Merkel, to other members of the European community, that that balanced approach is what's needed right now. They're going to be meeting this week to try to advance those discussions further. We've offered to be there for consultation to provide any technical assistance and work through some of these ideas in terms of how we can stabilize the markets there.Ultimately, what I think is most important is that Europe recognizes this euro project involves more than just a currency. It means that there's got to be some more effective coordination on the fiscal and the monetary side and on the growth agenda. And I think that there was strong intent there to move in that direction. Of course, they've got 17 countries that have to agree to every step they take. So I think about my one Congress, then I start thinking about 17 congresses, and I start getting a little bit of a headache. It's going to be challenging for them.The last point I'll make is, I do sense greater urgency now than perhaps existed 2 years ago or 2 1/2 years ago. And keep in mind, just for folks here in the States, when we look backwards at our response in 2008 and 2009, there was some criticism because we had to make a bunch of tough political decisions.In fact, there's still criticism about some of the decisions we made. But one of the things we were able to do was to act forcefully to solve a lot of these problems early, which is why credit markets that were locked up started loosening up again. That's why businesses started investing again. That's why we've seen job growth of over 4 million jobs over the last 2 years. That's why corporations are making money, and that's why we've seen strong economic growth for a long time.And so acting forcefully, rather than in small, bite-sized pieces and increments, I think, ends up being a better approach, even though obviously we're still going through challenges ourselves. I mean, some of these issues are ones that built up over decades.All right? Stephen Collinson [Agence France-Presse]. Where's Stephen?",

    "North Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?To the recent Japan-R.O.K. summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a stand-alone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?And in East and South Seas, by maritime advancement, is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for ? And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But thank you. [] I'll try to answer all of it. [] I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said one question. [] At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G-7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.And you know\u2014and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.If my memory serves me well\u2014and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister\u2014we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where\u2014to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country\u2014or 150,000 forces and invade that country\u2014invade that country without any rationale other than\u2014if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was\u2014just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand\u2014if we had stood still, what signal would that send to about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the\u2014let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.But\u2014and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe.I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, Well, that's only a European problem. There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War II.And so\u2014as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the\u2014President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly\u2014constantly.And your other two questions about \u2014I'll just say this: This summit was not about . That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come\u2014 obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by , but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.Think about what's going\u2014at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long. []But as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place.

    "Okay. Athena, without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.When I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don't know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him and Members of Congress and reaching out to constituencies that didn't vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don't think any President ever comes in saying to himself, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.But it's only been 6 days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.",
    "Very well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace\u2014to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.",
    "Well, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision. I have one vote. I have the same vote you do. I have the vote that all the voters who are eligible all across the country have. I've offered my opinion, but ultimately, it's the American people's decision to make collectively. And if somebody wins the election and they are President, then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything I can to help them succeed.It is\u2014I don't even really know where to start on answering this question. [] Of course, the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? [] The Federal Government doesn't run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country, they are the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.Now, we do take seriously\u2014as we always do\u2014our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful. If we see jurisdictions that are violating Federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing ramps for disabled voters or are discriminating in some fashion or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that.But this will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes, folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election.If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. [] That doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.Barbara Starr [CNN].",

    "First of all, have you ever known Wall Street not in consternation? Number one.Look, I think we've done a pretty damn good job. People's savings are secure, and even those beyond the $250,000 the FDIC is guaranteeing them. And the American taxpayer is not going to have to pay a penny. The banks are in pretty good shape. What's going on in Europe isn't a direct consequence of what's happening in the United States.And I\u2014what we would do is, if we find that there's more instability than appears, we'd be in a position to have the FDIC use the power it has to guarantee those loans above 250, like they did already.And so I think it's going to take a little while for things to just calm down. But I don't see anything that's on the horizon that's about to explode. But I do understand there's an unease about this. And these mid-sized banks have to be able to survive, and I think they'll be able to do that.",

And that process is beginning shortly. And I may add that Estonia is constantly\u2014has been raising this question.

    "Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I think that\u2014I always like to say, as\u2014you know, either way, when you look at it, the Governors are working with me. I'm working with the Governor. We're working hand in hand. I think we're all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the Governors. Very, very good relationships.I could say I'm fully responsible. But you know, one day, we had a virus come in, and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. And nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily infected China.Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe\u2014coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have\u2014if it's one person, it's too much. But we're at, let's say, 140,000; we could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn't.So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened. China should have stopped it.Please.",
    "The last part\u2014to the last question, yes. When we talked about whether or not we'd\u2014the three meetings we talked about. And we talked about: We would go from there, if there was reason to, to go to a summit. We talked about a summit as being before the Ukraine item came up in terms of strategic doctrine and what the strategic relationship would be. So I still think that is a possibility, number one.Number two, I am very concerned. I'm very concerned that this could end up being\u2014look, the only war that's worse than one that's intended is one that's unintended. And what I'm concerned about is, this could get out of hand\u2014very easily get out of hand because of what you said: the borders of the\u2014of Ukraine and what Russia may or may not do.I am hoping that Vladimir Putin understands that he is\u2014short of a full-blown nuclear war, he's not in a very good position to dominate the world. And so I don't think he thinks that, but it is a concern. And that's why we have to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could, in fact, cost his country an awful lot.But I\u2014of course, you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade\u2014this has\u2014if he invades\u2014it hasn't happened since World War II.

    "Good.",
    "My gut tells me that\u2014 which my head tells me as well\u2014is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida is a serious threat to our homeland, and we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with\u2014by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again.And so it's a\u2014this is a serious issue that is going to outlast my Presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is a ideological conflict that\u2014where you've got a competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the asymmetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and suicide bombers are the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve strategic objectives.Their objective is to impose their vision on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose with the Taliban on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interest to spread an alternative ideology.We have done this before in our Nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important, as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century, that we not forget that liberty can transform societies.Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe, strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised; I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were, to defy that many threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised.And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists, Mark. It is a\u2014this\u2014we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root.I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't become isolationist. That's why I've told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're\u2014one, we view them as strategic partners, and secondly, that we want them to work toward a freer societies and to help this Iraqi Government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner.And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can achieve; I know we've got to achieve the objective, so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, do we do it now, or basically pull back, let the Gallup Poll, or whatever poll there are, decide the fate of the country? And my view is, is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves, because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country.Ed.",
    "No and yes. No, I don't think there's a lot of respect that China has for Russia or for Putin. I don't think they're looking at it as a particular alliance. Matter of fact, they've been sort of keeping their distance a little bit.I do think that it remains to be seen whether Xi Jinping has decided that\u2014or backed off of his initial judgment that he wanted Ukraine\u2014excuse me, China to have the most powerful military in the world, as well as the largest economy.And\u2014but he's a long way from both.

    "Well, Stephen, I think that we have both a moral obligation and a national security interest in, A, ending the slaughter in Syria, but, B, also ensuring that we've got a stable Syria that is representative of all the Syrian people and is not creating chaos for its neighbors. And that's why for the last 2 years, we have been active in trying to ensure that Bashar Asad exits the stage and that we can begin a political transition process.That's the reason why we've invested so much in humanitarian aid. That's the reason why we are so invested in helping the opposition and why we've mobilized the international community to isolate Syria. That's why we are now providing nonlethal assistance to the opposition, and that's why we're going to continue to do the work that we need to do.And in terms of the costs and the benefits, I think there'd be severe costs in doing nothing. That's why we're not doing nothing. That's why we are actively invested in the process. If what you're asking is, are there continuing reevaluations about what we do, what actions we take in conjunction with other international partners to optimize the day when\u2014or to hasten the day when we can see a better situation in Syria, we've been doing that all along and we'll continue to do that.I think that, understandably, there is a desire for easy answers. That's not the situation there. And my job is to constantly measure our very real and legitimate humanitarian and national security interests in Syria, but measuring those against my bottom line, which is what's in the best interest of America's security and making sure that I'm making decisions not based on a hope and a prayer, but on hard-headed analysis in terms of what will actually make us safer and stabilize the region.I would note\u2014not to answer the question that you lobbed over to \u2014that you suggested even in your question a perceived crossing of a red line. The operative word there, I guess, Stephen, is perceived. And what I've said is that we have evidence that there has been the use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, but I don't make decisions based on perceived. And I can't organize international coalitions around perceived. We've tried that in the past, by the way, and it didn't work out well.So we want to make sure that we have the best analysis possible. We want to make sure that we are acting deliberately. But I would just point out that there have been several instances during the course of my Presidency where I said I was going to do something, and it ended up getting done. And there were times when there were folks on the sidelines wondering why hasn't it happened yet and what's going on and why didn't it go on tomorrow? But in the end, whether it's bin Laden or Qaddafi, if we say we're taking a position, I would think at this point the international community has a pretty good sense that we typically follow through on our commitments. . With regard to actions towards Syria, what kind of message would that communicate to North Korea? That was the question. And recently, North Korea seems to be deescalating its threats and provocations. What seems to be behind that? You asked these two questions. In fact, North Korea is isolated at the moment, so it's hard to find anyone that could really accurately fathom the situation in North Korea. Its actions are all so very unpredictable. Hence, whether the Syrian situation would have an impact is hard to say for sure.Why is North Korea appearing to deescalate its threats and provocations? There's no knowing for sure. But what is clear and what I believe for sure is that the international community with regard to North Korea's bad behavior, its provocations, must speak with one voice, a firm message, and consistently send a firm message that they will not stand and that North Korea's actions in breach of international norms will be met with so-and-so sanctions and measures by the international community. At the same time, if it goes along the right way, there will be so-and-so reward. So if we consistently send that message to North Korea, I feel that North Korea will be left with no choice but to change.And instead of just hoping to see North Korea change, the international community must also consistently send that message with one voice to tell them and communicate to them that they have no choice but to change and to shape an environment where they are left with no choice but to make the strategic decision to change. And I think that's the effective and important way.",
    "Yes, John, any government that presumes to represent the majority of people must confront criminal elements or people who think they can live outside the law. And that's what's taking place in Basra and in other parts of Iraq. I would say this is a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq. There have been other defining moments up to now, but this is a defining moment as well. The decision to move troops\u2014Iraqi troops into Basra talks about Prime Minister Maliki's leadership.You know, one of the early questions I had to the Prime Minister was, would he be willing to confront criminal elements, whether they be Shi'a or Sunni? Would he, in representing people who want to live in peace, be willing to use force necessary to bring to justice those who take advantage of a vacuum or those who murder the innocent? And his answer was, Yes, sir, I will. And I said, Well, you'll have our support if that's the case, if you believe in evenhanded justice. And his decision to move into Basra shows evenhanded justice, shows he's willing to go after those who believe they're outside the law.This is a test and a moment for the Iraqi Government, which strongly has supported Prime Minister Maliki's actions. And it is an interesting moment for the people of Iraq, because in order for this democracy to survive, they must have confidence in their Government's ability to protect them and to be evenhanded.And so the other thing that's interesting about this, by the way, this happens to be one of the Provinces where the Iraq's are in the lead\u2014Iraqis are in the lead. And that's what they are in this instance. And the United States, of course, will provide them help if they ask for it and if they need it. But they are in the lead. And this is a good test for them. And, of course, routing out these folks who've burrowed in society, who take advantage of the ability to be criminals or the ability to intimidate citizens, is going to take a while. But it is a necessary part of the development of a free society. In answer to your question on Afghanistan, the message I would take to our friends and partners in Europe when we get to Bucharest is, all of us have got to share the burden. And it's built on an assumption that all of us share a common strategy. So the first message, I think, for all of our friends and partners there in Bucharest is, we need to sign up to a common script, both military and civil, in terms of how we actually prosecute and succeed in this conflict. And I believe we can. No point in being there unless you believe you can.And then the second thing is, once you've signed up to a common script, a common strategy, which has both civilian and military dimensions to it in an integrated fashion, to then say to all of our friends and partners, let's all step up to the plate to make this work\u2014and across the country of Afghanistan, not just in parts of it.I'm optimistic that we're going to make some progress in Bucharest. I know the President has put in a lot of effort with a lot of European leaders up until now. We've been talking to some ourselves. And I think we should look forward to a good outcome because the people of Afghanistan deserve a good outcome.If I could ask Mark Kenny for his question.",
    "Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals and how we track that more effectively, there may be some steps that we can take administratively, as opposed through legislation.As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, I think that we've seen for some time now that those who oppose any commonsense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear, on the part of gun owners, that somehow the Federal Government's about to take all your guns away. And there's probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business.But I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about. The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment. The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can't walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a shockingly rapid fashion. And surely we can do something about that.But part of the challenge that we confront is, is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, here it comes and that everybody's guns are going to be taken away. It's unfortunate, but that's the case. And if you look at over the first 4 years of my administration, we've tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books. But it would be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun owners have had their rights infringed.",
    "Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue? Well, maybe I'll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it's very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.. Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last 2 days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And their families' feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards early resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage, a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.And therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missiles. And we will be very loyal to Japan. Thank you.Jennifer Jacobs [Bloomberg News].",
    "You know, I meet with a lot of people on the subject of Iraq, and I should. There's a lot of opinions on both sides of the aisle about this issue. And my message to the Members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let's make sure our troops get funded, and let's make sure politicians don't tell our commanders how to conduct operations. Let's don't hamstring our people in the field. That's my message.Their message to me has been, you know, don't you think the Iraqi Government ought to do more? They recognize what I recognize, and these gentlemen up here particularly recognize: that without political progress, it's going to be hard to achieve a military victory in Iraq. In other words, the military can provide security so a political process can go forward.Look, the two questions you asked: One was about General Petraeus's report to the\u2014back\u2014around September about what's taking place in Baghdad. My attitude toward Congress is, why don't you wait and see what he says? Fund the troops, and let him come back and report to the American people. General Petraeus picked this date. He believes that there will be enough progress one way or the other to be able to report to the American people, to give an objective assessment about what he sees regarding the Baghdad security plan.It's at that point in time that I'm confident that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs will take a look at what David Petraeus says and make recommendations about troop levels based upon the conditions on the ground, which stands in stark contrast to Members of Congress who say, we're going to determine troop levels based upon politics or the latest opinion poll or how we can get our Members elected.And the second part of your question was about benchmarks. Look, let me talk about this recent effort by Congress to fund our troops. The idea that the House of Representatives put forward is one that we will fund our troops by piecemeal. Secretary Gates was very strong about why that's a bad idea. And the American people must understand that if you fund our troops every 2 months, you're in a\u2014put in a position where we have to delay certain procurement, or that military contracts must be delayed. There's a lot of uncertainty in funding when it comes to 2-month cycles. So we reject that idea. It won't work.I find it odd that the Congress is\u2014I find it ironic that the Congress is ready to fully fund unrelated domestic spending items and only one-half of the money requested for our troops. They provide 100 percent of the money for the special interest projects that\u2014they don't have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, and 50 percent of the money to go to those who wear our uniform. They got it wrong. They ought to provide 100 percent of the money for people who wear the uniform and leave these special pork projects out of the bill. The\u2014and so I'll veto the bill if it's this haphazard, piecemeal funding. And I made that clear.One message I have heard from people from both parties and\u2014is that the idea of benchmarks makes sense. And I agree. It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward. And so I've empowered Josh Bolten to find common ground on benchmarks, and he will continue to have dialog with both Republicans and Democrats.You know, this bill\u2014I believe we can get a good supplemental, and I hope it's as quick as possible. The first blush is the bad supplemental coming out of the House. Nevertheless, there is\u2014the Senate will have a say, and then there will be a conference committee, and hopefully, we can move a good bill forward as quickly as possible. These gentlemen will tell you that the longer we wait, the more it hurts our military and the families.Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters].",
    "Okay. The\u2014it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.Point number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world\u2014even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families\u2014families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom\u2014defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't\u2014we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised\u2014it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal\u2014and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community\u2014the country that was most opposed to this deal\u2014that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].",
    "Well, I\u2014my guess is\u2014I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away\u2014[]\u2014for a week around\u2014between Christmas and Thanksgiving. [] And my guess is it would be early next year we make that judgment.",
    "Part of what I think leadership requires\u2014and I hope I meet this standard\u2014is letting people know you understand their problem. Again, my dad used to have an expression. He said, I don't expect the Government to solve my problems, but I expect them to at least know what they are, understand them.And like a lot of you, we've been very fortunate as a family, but we've also been through a lot of fairly tough times. And it's not\u2014and I've had the great advantage of having a family to get through them.When my first wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my wife and\u2014killed my first wife and killed my daughter, and my two boys were expected to die; they were in the\u2014it took the jaws of life 3 hours to get them out. They were on top of their dead mother and dead sister. I understand what that pain is like.And when Jill and I lost Beau after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star and Conspicuous Service Medal, a major in the United States military, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived about 200\u2014between 2- and 500 yards from burn pit that's 10 feet deep and as big as a football field, burning every toxic waste you could find.You know, I think that we understand what it's like to lose family members, mothers, fathers, to cancer\u2014all of you have been through that kind of thing. We've been fortunate though. We've had each other. We've had strong families\u2014Jill's sisters, my brothers, my sister.And so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there's help available, make sure there's people who are there to help\u2014whether they are a psychologist or whether they're medical doctors or whether they're social workers\u2014to be there to help, to help just hold a hand.And, for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you're talking about, if we\u2014reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40 percent when it was in place. I couldn't get it passed the second time around.So there's a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it's communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don't understand, because they\u2014I don't want people having to know the pain.But the second piece of that is, let them know that you are there to help. You're there to help.And one of the things I've talked with Vivek Murthy about\u2014and a lot of you have written about it, and you've written it well about it\u2014is the need for mental health care in America. You know, when we got elected, there were something like, I don't know, 2-, 3-, 5 million people who had gotten their COVID shots.Well, in the meantime\u2014I've got over 220 million people all three shots. But in the meantime, what happened? We lost over a million dead. A million dead.I read one study that for those million people, they had nine people who were\u2014each one of them had, on average, nine people close to them. A relative, someone they're married to, a child\u2014someone close.The impact has been profound. It's been profound. Think of all the people\u2014think of all your children and your grandchildren who didn't have that senior prom, who didn't have that graduation party, who didn't have all the things we had that we took for granted, that impact on their psyche.So there's a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just on what a person demonstrates they understand\u2014of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we're trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it too. I don't mean this as a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we've got a problem.Okay, excuse me. These 10 questions are really going quickly. []",
    "We are not going to stop.",
    "When it comes to defense spending, all of us have to make sure that our defense forces are efficient, effective; that for every dollar or lira that we're spending, that we're getting the most defense for our money.And so in the United States, we've reduced our defense spending as we've brought two wars to a close. There's a natural transition. The kinds of spending increases that we had seen were unsustainable. And I recognize that in Europe\u2014and I discussed this with both as well as President Napolitano\u2014there are opportunities for greater efficiencies, not only within a country's own defenses, but also by collaborating between European countries so that you don't have too much duplication and excess capacity. And in fact, Secretary General Rasmussen has repeatedly put forward plans for building NATO defense capacity in ways that reduce duplication and ensure that we are getting the most for our money.But having said that, there is a certain irreducible commitment that countries have to make if they're serious about NATO and the defense alliance. And I've been very realistic, I think, with my European partners: We, the United States, obviously have the largest military in the world, and we recognize we have some extraordinary responsibilities. We don't expect every country to duplicate exactly what we do. We have responsibilities in the Middle East. We have responsibilities in Asia, Latin America. We welcome those responsibilities, and we understand that that is a particular role that we play. But we're also a partnership in NATO, and it\u2014we can't have a situation in which the United States is consistently spending over 3 percent of our GDP on defense, much of that focused on Europe, potentially more if we end up having ongoing crises within Europe, and Europe is spending, let's say, 1 percent. The gap becomes too large.Obviously, small countries will still be having a lot less capacity than us, but proportionally to their GDP, we need to make sure that everybody is doing their fair share. That's not just for our benefit, it's also because Europe is going to have its own unique defense needs. spoke about the Mediterranean. Conceivably, Italy is going to develop more and more specialized capacity in addressing particular challenges in North Africa or in other parts of the Mediterranean. Well, that's going to require some resources in order to do that. So this is not something that's going to have to happen overnight, but there has to be a trajectory that recognizes the need for everybody pitching in, because we\u2014as I said yesterday, we cannot take our freedom for granted.[] Yes, we did speak about the two riflemen who are being illegally detained in India. And I thanked the U.S. and the U.S. Government for the support that they've given us in this phase of the international discussion, and I've asked to be able to count on further support. We want the issue to be dealt with at an ever more international level.But I need to be honest with you, and therefore, I need to say something about the questions that you addressed to , but also to the Italian Government. In other words, I agree; I know what means when he says that freedom cannot come free of charge. And we cannot complain that there is pain and suffering in the world unless we wish to deal with these problems through an alliance based on freedom and democracy, and common and shared values. We have to shoulder our responsibilities.And I think that Italy always has done its share over the years. We know where our strengths are, what the numbers are, but I think we've always been highly devoted and deeply committed. And I thank for having yet\u2014recognized yet again the strong partnership between our countries. I mean, when Italians have been asked to shoulder responsibilities, they've always tried to do it with the utmost commitment and honor.And I think that over the coming years, we're going to have to insist on the concept that was just illustrated by the President; i.e., we have to become specialized, especially in certain areas. We cannot keep saying that the EU has a role to play and then pull back and say, well, the U.S. is there, and they're always going to come to support us in the end. That's not right. It's not fair. We are partners, and we have to work together. I agree with Now, the issues\u2014and the President said quite rightly\u2014pertaining to efficiencies and making our system more efficient, our public administration, we have to reduce costs there and in the defense sector. I mean, it's there for everyone to see. We wish to continue cooperating and collaborating with our partners. And we will, therefore, keep checking our budgets to make sure that we have the resources to intervene all over the world. And at the same time, we have to avoid any waste, and we know that in some sectors there has been waste. Julianna Goldman [Bloomberg News]. You get the last word.",
    "Well, the answer is yes, but we have money to do other things, and we have a lot of money that was unspent, and we'll be able to do things with the money that was unspent. We have significant money that was unspent, and we will be able to use that for different purposes.Go ahead.",
    "Well, I think we're doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look\u2014if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flareups in nations that they were talking about\u2014and don't forget: We're much bigger, other than India and China. China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.And I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like, we thought we might be over it in Florida, and then, all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back.But I think we're doing very well. I told Dr. Birx I think we're doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She's a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi has treated her very badly\u2014very, very badly. Very nasty. And I'm just referring to the fact that I thought that, really, they should say the job we've done, whether it's on ventilators or testing\u2014we've tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great\u2014in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. And I think we're just doing very well.",
    "Well, I'm going to have to act alone because we don't have enough resources. We've already been very clear: We've run out of money. And we are going to have to reallocate resources in order to just make sure that some of the basic functions that have to take place down there, whether it's making sure that these children are properly housed or making sure we've got enough immigration judges to process their cases, that those things get done. We're going to have to reallocate some resources.But the broader point, Wendell, is that if in fact House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress\u2014despite the fact that I've taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that or the Republican predecessor before that\u2014then the easiest way to solve it is passing legislation. Get things done.On the supplemental, we agreed on 80 percent of the issues. There were 20 percent of the issues that perhaps there were disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. As I said to one Republican colleague who was down here that I was briefing about some national security issues, why wouldn't we just go ahead and pass the 80 percent that we agree on and we'll try to work to resolve the differences on the other 20 percent? Why wouldn't we do that? And he didn't really have a good answer for it.So there's no doubt that I can always do better on everything, including making additional calls to Speaker Boehner and having more conversations with some of the House Republican leadership. But in the end, the challenge I have right now is that they are not able to act even on what they say their priorities are, and they're not able to work and compromise even with Senate Republicans on certain issues. And they are\u2014they consider what have been traditionally Republican-supported initiatives, they consider those as somehow a betrayal of the cause.Take the example of the Export-Import Bank. This is an interesting thing that's happened. I mean, this is a program in which we help to provide financing to sell American goods and products around the world. Every country does this. It's traditionally been championed by Republicans. For some reason, right now the House Republicans have decided that we shouldn't do this, which means that when American companies go overseas and they're trying to close a sale on selling Boeing planes, for example, or a GE turbine or some other American product that has all kinds of subcontractors behind it and is creating all kinds of jobs and all sorts of small businesses depend on that sale, and that American company is going up against a German company or a Chinese company, and the Chinese and the American\u2014German company are providing financing and the American company isn't, we may lose that sale.Why\u2014when did that become something that Republicans opposed? It would be like me having a car dealership for Ford, and the Toyota dealership offers somebody financing, and I don't. We will lose business and we'll lose jobs if we don't pass it.So there are some big issues where I understand why we have differences. All right? On taxes, Republicans want to maintain some corporate loopholes I think need to be closed because I think that we should be giving tax breaks to families that are struggling with childcare or trying to save for a college education. On health care, obviously, their view is, is that we should not be helping folks get health care, even though it's through the private marketplace. My view is, is that in a country as wealthy as ours, we can afford to make sure that everybody has access to affordable care.Those are legitimate policy arguments. But getting our Ambassadors confirmed? These are career diplomats, not political types. Making sure that we pass legislation to strengthen our borders and put more folks down there? Those shouldn't be controversial. And I think you'd be hard-pressed to find an example of where I wouldn't welcome some reasonable efforts to actually get a bill passed out of Congress that I could sign.Last question, Michelle Kosinski [CNN].",
    "I have to tell you that this week I've been pretty busy, focused on Ukraine and focused on ISIL and focused on making sure that NATO is boosting its commitments and following through on what's necessary to meet 21st-century challenges.Jeh Johnson and Eric Holder have begun to provide me some of their proposals and recommendations. I'll be reviewing them. And my expectation is that fairly soon, I'll be considering what the next steps are.What I'm unequivocal about is that we need immigration reform, that my overriding preference is to see Congress act. We had bipartisan action in the Senate. The House Republicans have sat on it for over a year. That has damaged the economy, it has held America back. It is a mistake. And in the absence of congressional action, I intend to take action to make sure that we're putting more resources on the border, that we're upgrading how we process these cases, and that we find a way to encourage legal immigration and give people some path so that they can start paying taxes and pay a fine and learn English and be able to not look over their shoulder, but be legal, since they've been living here for quite some time.So I suspect that on my flight back, this will be part of my reading, taking a look at some of the specifics that we've looked at. And I'll be making an announcement soon.But I want to be very clear: My intention is, in the absence of action by Congress, I'm going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office, because it's the right thing to do for the country.

    "Well, keep in mind that the transition policy was in place and established at Lisbon, and we've been following that strategy that calls for us turning over increasing responsibility to Afghans and a full transition so that our combat role is over by the end of 2014. And our coalition partners have agreed to it. They are sticking with it. That continues to be the plan.What we are now going to be doing over the next--at this NATO meeting and planning for the next 2 years is to make sure that that transition is not a cliff, but that there are benchmarks and steps that are taken along the way, in the same way that we reduced our role in Iraq, so that it is gradual, Afghan capacity is built, the partnering with Afghan security forces is effective, that we are putting in place the kinds of support structures that are needed in order for the overall strategy to be effective.Now, yes, the situation with the Koran burning concerns me. I think that it is an indication of the challenges in that environment, and it's an indication that now is the time for us to transition.Obviously, the violence directed at our people is unacceptable. And President Karzai acknowledged that. But what is also true is President Karzai, I think, is eager for more responsibility on the Afghan side. We're going to be able to find a mechanism whereby Afghans understand their sovereignty is being respected and that they're going to be taking a greater and greater role in their own security. That, I think, is in the interest of Afghans. It's also in our interests. And I'm confident we can execute, but it's not going to be a smooth path. There are going to be bumps along the road just as there were in Iraq.",
    "First of all, it's the Supreme Court decision. We'll abide by the Court's decision. That doesn't mean I have to agree with it. It's a deeply divided Court, and I strongly agree with those who dissented that. And their dissent was based upon their serious concerns about U.S. national security.Congress and the administration worked very carefully on a piece of legislation that set the appropriate procedures in place as to how to deal with the detainees. And we'll study this opinion, and we'll do so with this in mind, to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say\u2014or truly say to the American people, we're doing everything we can to protect you.

What's really interesting is, the battle has changed in Iraq from the rejectionists and former Ba'athists and definitely foreign fighters who have entered the country that were trying to destabilize the new Government to one that Mr. Zarqawi stated clearly\u2014he said, Look, let's kill Shi'a in order to create enough chaos and confusion and doubt of the Government, and set off a sectarian battle. And he succeeded in that extent. He didn't succeed at avoiding us, but he did succeed at starting off sectarian strife. And now the fundamental question is, what strategy is necessary to deal with this type of violence?We'll continue after Al Qaida. Al Qaida will not have safe haven in Iraq. And that's important for the American people to know. We've got special operators. We've got better intelligence. And there is\u2014Al Qaida is effective at these spectacular bombings, and we'll chase them down, and we are, along with the Iraqis. The strategy now is how to make sure that we've got the security situation in place such that the Iraqi Government is capable of dealing with the sectarian violence, as well as the political and economic strategies as well.So yes, I think you'll see something differently, because it's a practical answer to a situation on the ground that's not the way we'd like it. You wanted frankness; I thought we would succeed quicker than we did, and I am disappointed by the pace of success. I mean, look, there isn't any\u2014as I said a moment or two ago, there isn't any doubt about how tough this is. It's hugely challenging. But what the report did not say is that we should just get out and leave it. What it did say is that it's immensely important that we succeed.Now, the question is, therefore, how do we do it? And in that regard, I think the report is practical, it's clear, and it offers also the way of bringing people together.The other thing that we want to do, because this is part of succeeding in this mission, is actually to make people understand that this is something where you've got to try and bring people together around a set of common objectives and a practical set of methods to achieve those objectives.And, you know, the issues that the report raises\u2014I mean, these aren't issues that, obviously, no one has ever thought of; these aren't issues that haven't been part of the continual discussion and debate and iteration within the coalition and, indeed, between us and the Iraqi Government. But those essential elements\u2014we want to make sure, in the light of the changing situation that there is there, that, one, we have the Iraqi Government able to operate effectively, but in a nonsectarian way, because that's what we began with. Secondly, that we make sure that everyone in the region is supporting that. And thirdly, that we set this within the context of a broader vision for the Middle East, not least in respect of Israel and Palestine.Now, in respect of the elements of that strategy, this report gives us a basis on which we can move forward, but we've obviously then got to look at the practical measures that are necessary in order to give effect to those elements. And that's what we'll do. And I think that, you know, the one thing that no one who is dealing with this on a day-to-day basis has any doubt about is how tough it is. But the question is, how we make sure that we overcome those tough conditions and succeed, because the need to succeed is so huge.",

    "Just with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. [] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President\u2014next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus\u2014not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders\u2014think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around\u2014or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey. Not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need.So I'm proud that the United States is the single largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. I'm glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. But I also think the EU rightly wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that's necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it's absorbing and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they're being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under: at enormous profit and without regard for human life.",

    "There is a inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble. I mean, folks didn't have any complaints about my leadership style when I was running around Iowa for a year. And they got a pretty good look at me up close and personal, and they were able to lift the hood and kick the tires. And I think they understood that my story was theirs. I might have a funny name, I might have lived in some different places, but the values of hard work and responsibility and honesty and looking out for one another that had been instilled in them by their parents, those were the same values that I took from my mom and my grandparents.And so the track record has been that when I'm out of this place, that's not an issue. When you're in this place, it is hard not to seem removed. And one of the challenges that we've got to think about is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the White House, which require a lot of hours and a lot of work, but still have that opportunity to engage with the American people on a day-to-day basis and know--give them confidence that I'm listening to them.Those letters that I read every night, some of them just break my heart. Some of them provide me encouragement and inspiration. But nobody's filming me reading those letters. And so it's hard, I think, for people to get a sense of, well, how's he taking in all this information?So I think there are more things that we can do to make sure that I'm getting out of here. But, I mean, I think it's important to point out as well that a couple of great communicators, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, were standing at this podium 2 years into their Presidency getting very similar questions because the economy wasn't working the way it needed to be and there were a whole range of factors that made people concerned that maybe the party in power wasn't listening to them.This is something that I think every President needs to go through, because the responsibilities of this office are so enormous and so many people are depending on what we do, and in the rush of activity, sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place.And that's something that--now, I'm not recommending for every future President that they take a shellacking like they--like I did last night. [] I'm sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons. But I do think that this is a growth process and an evolution. And the relationship that I've had with the American people is one that built slowly, peaked at this incredible high, and then during the course of the last 2 years, as we've, together, gone through some very difficult times, has gotten rockier and tougher. And it's going to, I'm sure, have some more ups and downs during the course of me being in this office.But the one thing that I just want to end on is getting out of here is good for me too, because when I travel around the country, even in the toughest of these debates--in the midst of health care last year during summer when there were protesters about, and when I'm meeting families who've lost loved ones in Afghanistan or Iraq--I always come away from those interactions just feeling so much more optimistic about this country.We have such good and decent people who, on a day-to-day basis, are finding all kinds of ways to live together and educate kids and grow their communities and improve their communities and create businesses and work together to create great new products and services. The American people always make me optimistic.And that's why, during the course of the last 2 years, as tough as it's been, as many sometimes scary moments as we've gone through, I've never doubted that we're going to emerge stronger than we were before. And I think that remains true, and I'm just going to be looking forward to playing my part in helping that journey along.All right. Thank you very much, everybody.",
    "Well, as I said in my opening statement, there's no doubt that Republicans had a good night. And what we're going to make sure that we do is to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who are now running both Chambers in Congress, and find out what their agenda is. And my hope is, is that they've got some specific things they want to do that correspond with some things that we want to get done. What's most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically, the last several is: Get stuff done. Don't worry about the next election. Don't worry about party affiliation. Do worry about our concerns. Worry about the fact that I'm a single mom and, at the end of the month, it's really hard for me to pay the bills, in part because I've got these huge childcare costs. Do worry about the fact that I'm a young person who's qualified to go to college, but I'm really worried about taking $50,000 a year out in debt, and I don't know how I'd pay that back. Do worry about the fact that I'm a construction worker who has been working all my life, and I know that there's construction work that should be done, but right now, for some reason, projects are stalled. If we're thinking about those folks, I think we're, hopefully, going to be able to get some stuff done.In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we're attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks who've lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but aren't properly documented\u2014give them a chance to pay their back taxes, get in the back of the line, but get through a process that allows them to get legal.The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system, but our economy, and would improve business conditions here in the United States and make sure that American-born workers aren't undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren't always paid a fair wage, and as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing.So we got a bipartisan bill out of the Senate. I asked John Boehner at that point, can we pass this through the House? There's a majority of votes in the House to get this passed. And Speaker Boehner, I think, was sincere about wanting to pass it, but had difficulty over the last year trying to get it done.So when he finally told me he wasn't going to call it up this year, what I indicated to him is, I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away.That's a commitment I made not just to the American people and to businesses and the evangelical community and law enforcement folks and everybody who's looked at this issue and thinks that we need immigration reform; that's a commitment that I also made to John Boehner, that I would act in the absence of action by Congress.So before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border, where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern. And at the same time, I'll be reaching out to both Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and other Republican as well as Democratic leaders to find out how it is that they want to proceed. And if they want to get a bill done, whether it's during the lame duck or next year, I'm eager to see what they have to offer.But what I'm not going to do is just wait. I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I'm going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let's figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.",
    "Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It\u2014called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates\u2014what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors. That's why AARP has endorsed us. Okay.Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune].",

And they will pull me aside and say, Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? And I did receive complaints about U.S. attorneys.I specifically remember one time I went up to the Senate, and Senators were talking about the U.S. attorneys.

    "Not only have I run my last election, but I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections. That is your job. [] And there's no shortage of people who are happy to opine on that. I will not be one of them.On Cuba, we are not in the business of regime change. We are in the business of making sure the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to participate and shape their own destiny and their own lives and supporting civil society.And there's going to be an evolution, regardless of what we do, inside of Cuba. Partly, it's going to be generational. If you listened to President Castro's comments earlier this morning, a lot of the points he made referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message here is, the cold war is over. There's still a whole lot of challenges that we face and a lot of issues around the world, and we're still going to have serious issues with Cuba on not just the Cuban Government's approach to its own people, but also regional issues and concerns. There are going to be areas where we cooperate as well. Cuban doctors deployed during the Ebola crisis made a difference; Cuban activity in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake made a difference. And so there may be areas of collaboration as well.What I said to President Castro is the same thing that I've said to leaders throughout the region: We have a point of view, and we won't be shy about expressing it. But I'm confident that the way to lift up the values that we care about is through persuasion. And that's going to be the primary approach that we take on a whole host of these issues, primarily because they don't implicate our national security in a direct way.And I think that we have to be very clear: Cuba is not a threat to the United States. That doesn't mean we don't have differences with it. But on the list of threats that I'm concerned about, I think it's fair to say that between ISIL and Iran getting a nuclear weapon and activities in Yemen and Libya and Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine and our\u2014the impact on our allies there\u2014I could go down a pretty long list\u2014climate change. [] So our\u2014I think our approach has to be one of trying to work with the region and other countries and be very clear about what we believe and what we stand for and what we think works and what doesn't.And so often, when we insert ourselves in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive. It backfires. That's been part of our history, and\u2014which is why countries keep on trying to use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let's take away the excuse. And let's be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everybody to try to lift up opportunity and prosperity and security for people in the region.Major Garrett [CBS News].",
    "I could not be prouder of the transformation that's taken place in our society just in the last decade. And I've said before, I think we made some useful contributions to it, but the primary heroes in this stage of our growth as a democracy and a society are all the individual activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, This is who I am, and I'm proud of it.And that opened people's minds and opened their hearts. And eventually, laws caught up. But I don't think any of that would have happened without the activism, in some cases, loud and noisy, but in some cases, just quiet and very personal.And I think that what we did as an administration was to help to\u2014the society to move in a better direction, but to do so in a way that didn't create an enormous backlash and was systematic and respectful of the fact that, in some cases, these issues were controversial. I think that the way we handled, for example, don't ask, don't tell\u2014being methodical about it, working with the Joint Chiefs, making sure that we showed this would not have an impact on the effectiveness of the greatest military on Earth\u2014and then to have Defense Secretary in Bob Gates and Chairman in Mike Mullen and a Joint Chiefs who were open to evidence and ultimately worked with me to do the right thing, I am proud of that. But again, none of that would have happened without this incredible transformation that was happening in society out there.You know, when I gave Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I meant what I said. I think somebody that kind and likeable projecting into living rooms around the country, that changed attitudes. And that wasn't easy to do for her. And that's just one small example of what was happening in countless communities all across the country.So I'm proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance.I don't think it is something that will be reversible because American society has changed; the attitudes of young people, in particular, have changed. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be some fights that are important\u2014legal issues, issues surrounding transgender persons\u2014there are still going to be some battles that need to take place.But if you talk to young people of Malia, Sasha's generation, even if they're Republicans, even if they're conservative, many of them would tell you, I don't understand how you would discriminate against somebody because of sexual orientation. That's just sort of burned into them in pretty powerful ways.April Ryan [American Urban Radio Network].",
    "Our biggest priority as an administration is getting the economy back on track and putting people back to work. Now, without relitigating the past, I'm absolutely convinced, and the vast majority of economists are convinced, that the steps we took in the Recovery Act saved millions of people their jobs or created a whole bunch of jobs.And part of the evidence of that is as you see what happens with the Recovery Act phasing out. When I came into office and budgets were hemorrhaging at the State level, part of the Recovery Act was giving States help so they wouldn't have to lay off teachers, police officers, firefighters. As we've seen that Federal support for States diminish, you've seen the biggest job losses in the public sector, teachers, police officers, firefighters losing their jobs.So my strong preference would be for us to figure out ways that we can continue to provide help across the board. But I'm operating within some political constraints here, because whatever I do has to go through the House of Representatives.What that means then is, is that among the options that are available to us is, for example, the payroll tax cut, which might not be exactly the kind of program that I would design in order to boost employment, but does make a difference because it puts money in the pockets of people who are then spending it at businesses, large and small. That gives them more customers, increases demand, and it gives businesses a greater incentive to hire. And that would be, for example, a component of this overall package.Unemployment benefits, again, puts money in the pockets of folks who are out there knocking on doors trying to find a job every day. Giving them those resources, that puts more money into the economy and that potentially improves it--improves the climate for businesses to want to hire.So as part of a component of a deal, I think it's very important for us to look at what are the steps we can take short term in order to put folks back to work. I am not somebody who believes that just because we solve the deficit and debt problems short term, medium term, or long term, that that automatically solves the unemployment problem. I think we're still going to have to do a bunch of stuff, including, for example, trade deals that are before Congress right now that could add tens of thousands of jobs.Republicans gave me this list at the beginning of this year as a priority, something that they thought they could do. Now I'm ready to do it, and so far we haven't gotten the kind of movement that I would have expected.We've got the potential to create an infrastructure bank that could put construction workers to work right now, rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our vital infrastructure all across the country. So those are still areas where, I think, we can make enormous progress.I do think that if the country as a whole sees Washington act responsibly, compromises being made, the deficit and debt being dealt with for 10, 15, 20 years, that that will help with businesses feeling more confident about aggressively investing in this country, foreign investors saying America has got its act together and are willing to invest. And so it can have a positive impact in overall growth and employment.It's not the only solution. We're still going to have to have a strong jobs agenda. But it is part of a solution. I might add it is the primary solution that the Republicans have offered when it comes to jobs. They keep on going out there and saying, Mr. President, what are you doing about jobs? And when you ask them, well, what would you do? We've got to get Government spending under control, and we've got to get our deficits under control. So I say, okay, let's go. Where are they? I mean, this is what they claim would be the single biggest boost to business certainty and confidence. So what's the holdup?With respect to Social Security, as I indicated earlier, making changes to these programs is so difficult that this may be an opportunity for us to go ahead and do something smart that strengthens Social Security and gives not just this generation but future generations the opportunity to say this thing is going to be in there for the long haul.Now, that may not be possible, and you're absolutely right that, as I said, Social Security is not the primary driver of our long-term deficits and debt. On the other hand, we do want to make sure that Social Security is going to be there for the next generations, and if there is a reasonable deal to be had on it, it is one that I'm willing to pursue.",

She met with the Japanese, the South Koreans, the Chinese, and the Russians. Her report is that all countries understand we must work closely together to solve this problem peacefully. And that means adhering to the latest United Nations Security Council resolution that was passed.The leader of North Korea likes to threaten. In my judgment, what he's doing is just testing the will of the five countries that are working together to convince him there is a better way forward for his people. I don't know the exact words he used, but he is\u2014this is not the first time that he's issued threats. And our goal is to continue to remind our partners that when we work together, we're more likely to be able to achieve the objective, which is to solve this problem diplomatically. And so I would report to you the coalition remains firm, and we will continue to work to see to it that it does remain firm.Baker [Peter Baker, Washington Post].",
    "I think both would be good for the economy. A payroll tax cut is something that has put a thousand dollars in the pocket of the typical American family over the last 6, 7 months and has helped offset some of the rising costs in gasoline and food. And I think that American consumers and American businesses would benefit from a continuation of that tax cut next year.Unemployment insurance--obviously, unemployment is still too high. And there are a lot of folks out there who are doing everything they can to find a job, but the market is still tight out there. And for us to make sure that they are able to stay in their homes potentially or they're able to still support their families, I think, is very important and contributes to the overall economy.So I think there are ways that you can essentially take a little over a trillion dollars in serious discretionary cuts, meaningful discretionary cuts, and then start building on top of that some cuts in non-health-care mandatory payments, ethanol programs, or how we calculate various subsidies to various industries. That could potentially be layered on. And we could still do something like a tax cut for ordinary families that would end up benefiting the economy as a whole.That is not my preferable option, though. I just want to be clear. I think about this like a layer cake. You can do the bare minimum, and then you can make some progressively harder decisions to solve the problem more and more.And we're in a position now where if we're serious about this and everybody is willing to compromise, we can, as I said before, fix this thing probably for a decade or more. And that's something that I think would be good for the overall business climate and would encourage the American people that Washington actually is willing to take care of its business.",
    "Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We're going to be watching very much to see. Now, it got a little bit waylaid by the virus.But look, I'd love to have a good relationship with China. But if you look\u2014and we made a phenomenal deal. China has paid\u2014because of me, China has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time. Billions of\u2014some of that money has been spent to farmers, where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can't let that happen.So we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now, I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi; I think he will live up to it. If he doesn't live up to it, that will be okay too, because we have very, very good alternatives.",
    "To the latter, I\u2014look, I mean, he's a neighbor. And the message needs to be, quit sending in sophisticated equipment that's killing our citizens, and that the message will be that we're negotiating a long-term security agreement with the United States precisely because we want enough breathing space for our democracy to develop.My message is for him, stop exporting terror, and that the international community is serious about continuing to isolate Iran until they come clean about their nuclear weapons ambitions. And that's why there will be action in the United Nations here early next week as we work collaboratively to continue to send a clear message.In terms of troop levels, there is going to be enormous speculation, again, about what decision I will make. I can only tell you, Deb, that it's going to be based upon the recommendations of Secretary Gates, General Petraeus, the Joint Chiefs. My sole criterion is, whatever we do, it ought to be in the context of success.If we fail in Iraq, the consequences for world peace will be enormous; the consequences for the security of the United States will be enormous. And therefore, my question is, what does it take to succeed? And we're not going to let politics drive my decision\u2014again. If I worried about polls and focus groups, I wouldn't have sent more troops in. I sent more troops in because the situation was unacceptable. And now we're succeeding. And so therefore, Ryan Crocker\u2014the Ambassador\u2014and General Petraeus will be coming back, and they'll report to the country, and they'll report to me. And the decisions\u2014you'll see them evolve.",
    "Well, that's your question. []",
    "Well, I don't have a crystal ball, Ben, but I will say this. First of all, we've grown the economy by a million jobs over the last year. So that's pretty noticeable. I think those million people who've been hired notice those paychecks. And that's 10 consecutive months of private sector job growth.In order to speed up job growth, we've put forward a range of proposals that I hope to discuss with Democratic and Republican leaders, because I don't think we can just stand pat. I continue to believe that we need to invest in a creaky infrastructure back home. And I think as you travel around Asia, you start seeing other countries investing in infrastructure. That's what the United States has done in the past, but we've been living off the investments that we made back in the thirties, forties, fifties, and sixties. And it's time for us to make sure that we've upgraded our roads and our railways and our airports. That will make us more productive and will put people back to work right now.I continue to believe that it is important for us to work with businesses to see if we can incentivize them to invest now rather than holding cash waiting for the future. They've got cash to spend. And so we've put forward a series of tax proposals that historically Republicans have supported. And my expectation would be, there's no reason for them not to support it just because I'm supporting it. And so that's a conversation that I hope to have next week.But we have a recovery. It needs to be speeded up. Government can't hire back the 8 million people who lost their jobs. Ultimately, that's up to the private sector. But I think we can set the conditions whereby we're seeing significant improvement during the course of the next year, the next 2 years, and we can chip away at the unemployment rate so that we get back to the kinds of levels that reflect a growing middle class and increased opportunity for all people.Jake Tapper [ABC News].",

    "I don't know that they're putting it in this bill, but I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old, and it's really\u2014it was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And it's got a lot of danger involved and panels falling off the outside and pieces of concrete falling off the building.And they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to him, Frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There's nothing better than the site. The site they have now is better. But they were looking in sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would have been too far away.So I am\u2014I've been encouraging them to build it. And if you're going to\u2014you have a choice: You can renovate the existing building\u2014but it's not a good building\u2014or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years and have it be incredible. Even with tracks on top, they're talking about\u2014you know, we have\u2014because FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter-mile tracks on top. It's a very big site, a very wide site.So I think the idea\u2014the best idea would be to build a new building. And that way, you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else. But the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done.Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.",
    "Man! [] ! [] We discussed a common strategy to deal with a common problem, and that is narcotrafficking and violence on our border. First, let me say that in order to develop an effective, common strategy requires\u2014there needs to be serious consultations between our respective governments. It's one thing to say, we're interested in working together, it's another thing to develop a package on both sides of the border that will be effective in dealing with the problem. That's what our people expect us to do. They expect us to see a problem and to develop an effective strategy to deal with that problem. President Calderon and I met in Mexico, and we had a serious discussion to get this initiative on the table. This is an interim meeting, a meeting for us to make sure that the strategy that's being developed is\u2014 will be effective. And so we reviewed where we are in the process.The United States is committed to this joint strategy to deal with a joint problem. I would not be committed to dealing with this if I wasn't convinced that President Calderon had the will and the desire to protect his people from narcotraffickers. He has shown great leadership and great strength of character, which gives me good confidence that the plan we'll develop will be effective. And the fundamental question is, what can we do together to make sure that the common strategy works? And that's where we are in the discussions right now.There's all kinds of speculation about the size of the package, this, that, and the other. All I can tell you is, the package, when it's developed, will be robust enough to achieve a common objective, which is less violence on both sides of the border and to deal with narcotrafficking. And we both have responsibilities. And that's what the package is entailed to develop. It's to develop how do we share our joint responsibilities.It's in our interests that this program go forward. You mentioned Plan Colombia; this is not like Plan Colombia. This is different from Plan Colombia. This is a plan that says, we've got an issue on our own border. We share a border, and therefore, it's a joint program that will mean\u2014that won't mean U.S. armed presence in your country. Mexico is plenty capable of handling the problem. And the question is, is there any way for us to help strengthen the effort? And so that's what we're studying.And I can't give you a definitive moment when the plan will be ready, but we're working hard to get a plan ready. And it's a plan that, once it's proposed and out there, I strongly urge the United States Congress to support. It's in our interests, it's in the U.S. interests that we get this issue solved. Thank you, President Bush, for your comments and also for the question, because this allows us to emphasize the fact that\u2014well, the President has already said, it's a common strategy to combat, in a coordinated way, a common problem. Drug trafficking and violence that's associated to drug trafficking, which is particularly evident on the border between the U.S. and Mexico, cannot be dealt with in an isolated way. It has to be confronted by, dealt with by the people and by the governments that are directly affected by this scourge. And it requires a variety, a multiplicity of actions carried out by society, by governments, in other words, enforcement activities against criminals, preventive activities, protective activities, prevention and treatment of addictions with the young.Now, I agree with President Bush; it's very important to reduce\u2014well, to have clear policies to reduce the consumption patterns in terms of drugs, including Mexico, because this is a main cause of the problem that we're facing.Now, last week, for example, last week, three Federal policemen were murdered in Mexico\u2014Mexican policemen, that is\u2014and they were tortured in a very cowardly way. And those Mexican policemen are fully committed towards the Government to free the young Mexicans from drugs and to free Mexican society from slavery on the part of organized crime based on money and technology. And I don't want any\u2014not one single Mexican policeman to have a logistical disadvantage when facing these criminals. I don't want my Government to be responsible for any omission, any legal omission within a legal framework that would have been directed towards defeating these criminals.So this is a common strategy because it means that the U.S. will do its part and Mexico will do its part. Now, what do we want the U.S. to do\u2014to carry out\u2014have greater surveillance along the border. We are seeing high-powered weapons into Mexico, and we know that we can do much more than we're doing at this point in time. I know that drugs go from Mexico to the U.S. Both of us have to agree so that there is surveillance, efficient surveillance, that is, on both sides of the border. We are facing mafias that are working on both sides of the border. That is quite clear to us. And I think that we will not be acting in an efficient way as long as they have a coordinated strategy and we don't. In other words, they're coordinated on both sides of the border; we are not.So I would like to introduce into the\u2014 well, we have to be respectful of our legislation, our respective legislations. I would want to create a strategy in order to defeat this scourge. And that requires a variety of instruments, strategies, exchange of intelligence, exchange of technology. It also means that we have to keep in mind issues of sovereignty. I told President Bush, though, we did not want to have U.S. soldiers working in our country, as has happened in other countries. I know that that's typical, of course. But we've said this very clearly, we put forth this very clearly, and in the framework of our own legislations, we will find a way out.And I would also wonder what the men and women are thinking now, those who are suffering from crime, how scared are they, what's the degree of their fear that has led these groups to be so powerful, to grow so much. And they've essentially taken power in their area of operation. We have developed an aggressive policy to combat organized crime, and I haven't hesitated to use our forces to recover the areas. We've taken about 10,000 drug traffickers to jail, many weapons, 50-millimeter cannons, grenades capable of bringing down aircraft.And I think\u2014so I cannot send the Mexican policemen to combat this situation with their hands tied. So I have to answer to the Mexican people in order to preserve their security, and I will do so without abusing human rights and without distorting Mexican legislation. I will respect Mexican legislation fully. But I am calling upon my neighbor in order to act in a coordinated way, because it's a situation we both have to face. It's a problem that affects two countries, and only together will we be able to solve it.There are several causes. It involves several joint responsibilities. And the action, therefore, has to be shared, within the legal framework. What's the scope of this strategy? I cannot tell you now; we cannot tell you now. We're just exchanging assessments, needs, assessing the situation and making it clear what the rules are for each country.We will have a strategy\u2014I think it's possible\u2014but we will not be able to come up with it until we finish our discussions and negotiations, which, by nature, are very complex. But in the end, that is what we're trying to combat. And it's a problem that's affecting Mexican citizens as well as U.S. nationals. This is an example. We are all sovereign nations, that is quite true, but we are not isolated problems according to our own sovereignty. We have shared problems\u2014for example, drug trafficking. This is a good example. It begins in a country in the Americas or in the Caribbean, but the consequences are seen in the streets in Canada. And we have to discuss these problems. We have to compare our strategies, and sometimes we have to work hand in hand.[.]Once again, this is a perfect example of why we meet. We're sovereign countries, but problems are not\u2014problems don't limit themselves to the boundaries of our countries. Drug trafficking is a perfect example. These problems may originate in some of the countries of Latin America or the Caribbean, but the problems are felt on the streets and the communities of Canada. And that's why we meet to discuss; that's why we meet to compare strategies; that's why we, from time to time, have to engage in shared action.Let me just say one other thing, if I can, about the drug trade, because indirect reference was made to Colombia. Canada has undertaken negotiations of a trade agreement with Colombia. We have a Government in Colombia that wants to share in the benefits of free and open markets. We don't need to have a trade agreement to have a drug trade with Colombia. The drug traffickers aren't going to wait for our parliaments or our congresses to pass a trade agreement in order to have a drug trade. But if we want to have other opportunities for the people of Colombia and mutual development and shared prosperity, we've got to move forward on these kinds of initiatives. And that's why the Government of Canada is committed to working with Colombia and getting a trade deal.",
    "I am listening to all these ideas. And some of them are constructive. And I'm listening to ideas in Congress, and I'm listening to ideas here. Look, I want to repeat here: My goal is to maintain the international norm on banning chemical weapons. I want that enforcement to be real. I want it to be serious. I want people to understand that gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children is not something we do. It's prohibited in active wars between countries. We certainly don't do it against kids. And we've got to stand up for that principle.If there are tools that we can use to ensure that, obviously my preference would be, again, to act internationally in a serious way and to make sure that Mr. Asad gets the message.I'm not itching for military action. Recall, Major, that I have been criticized for the last couple of years by some of the folks who are now saying they would oppose these strikes for not striking. And I think that I have a well-deserved reputation for taking very seriously and soberly the idea of military engagement.So we will look at these ideas. So far, at least, I have not seen ideas presented that, as a practical matter, I think would do the job. But this is a situation where part of the reason I wanted to foster debate was to make sure that everybody thought about both the ramifications of action and inaction.",

Now that one has been signed, I think it has cleared the way. There are many volunteers, and as Chair of the African Union, we certainly seek out more and more volunteers as they are needed.

    "Well, this letter was re-presented to Mr. President this afternoon. And I've also underlined the fact that a terrorist such as Ferhat Abdi Sahin should not be considered as an interlocutor by a country such as the United States. And this individual, Ferhat Abdi Sahin, has been instrumental in the killings of hundreds of Turkish civilians, and he is a person labeled as like a son for the terrorist leader who is currently incarcerated in Turkey, Abdullah \u00d6calan.So a person like this should not be welcomed by a country such as the United States. And similarly, this person was welcomed by a country such as Russia. So it's very difficult for me to understand these when we're trying to fight terrorism on a global scale. If we're going to sustain our fight against terrorism in a healthy fashion, we need to be much more sensitive than we currently are. It happens to us today, and it will happen to somebody else tomorrow is a saying that goes in our language.We have also provided information and the document thereof to our interlocutors in the White House, including Mr. President. And I have also submitted a document produced by CIA, pointing out to the fact that this individual is a terrorist, to Mr. President.And, as I've said before, I have shared them with His Excellency, Mr. President.

    "As you know, I'm having a regular conversation with the German Chancellor. We have a secure video that is beamed in the White House and her office, and so we consult regularly. And she expressed her concerns that the U.S. position wasn't very clear about the missile defense systems and that there were some people concerned in Germany, as well as Europe, about our intentions. And she also suggested that it might make sense for me to share my intentions more clearly with President Putin. And I took her advice very seriously.Our intention, of course, is to have a defense system that prevents rogue regimes from holding Western Europe and/or America to hostage. Evidently, the Russians view it differently. And so upon the advice of the Chancellor, I asked Secretary Gates to go to Moscow, where he had a very constructive meeting with President Putin. I called President Putin and asked him to see Secretary Gates, and that we would put forth an interesting information-sharing proposal.Our intention is to say to Russia that the system is something you ought to think about participating in. It's in your interests to have a system that would\u2014could prevent a future Iranian regime, for example, from launching a weapon\u2014it's in Russia's security interests. And therefore, we have started a dialog that, as a result of Secretary Gates's visit, that, hopefully, will make explicit our intentions and, hopefully, present the\u2014an opportunity to share with the Russians, so that they don't see us as an antagonistic force, but see us as a friendly force.",

    "Thank you--[inaudible]. You asked about 's impending launch of its long-range missile, and let me just reiterate once again, ladies and gentlemen: If goes ahead with its plan to test-launch its long-range missile, this is a clear violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. , if it goes ahead with its plan, will be going straight against its pledges that it made with the international community.The international community is urging the ns to repeal its announcement to test-fire its long-range missile. Now, your question was, what--how are we going to respond? I just want to answer that question by saying that if goes ahead with it, must be the sole country to bear the entire responsibility. As just mentioned, if it goes ahead with its plan, it will only deepen its isolation and all the consequences will have to face.And from the perspective of the people of , they will understand that its leader is spending hundreds of millions of dollars just to launch a long-range missile. And watching their leader do so, they're not going to feel proud that their country was able to launch a long-range missile, but rather, they will get--truly understand the nature of their leaders and understand why they have to go through such hardships today.So, domestically, I'm sure the n leaders are hoping to achieve some sort of--an objective by test-launching its long-range missile. But they must clearly understand that if they go ahead with the plan, that they will put themselves in a very difficult position. I urge the ns to come out as a responsible member of the international community, and that is the surest way to ensure a better life for the people of .In this regard, there is no difference of opinions between the U.S. and South Korea. We'll remain very calm and rational, and we will be wise in dealing with the ns if in fact they do go ahead with their announcement.You asked about extending the missile range of South Korea. We did not discuss that issue. Of course, working-level officials have been discussing this issue. But you have to look at this from a more holistic framework in that extending the missile range is part of increasing and enhancing our defense capabilities vis-a-vis . .

    "I think that, first of all, Iraq is a sovereign nation which is conducting its own foreign policy. They're having talks with their neighbors. And if that's what they think they ought to do, that's fine. I hope their talks yield results. One result that Iraq would like to see is for the Iranians to leave them alone. If Iran is going to be involved in their country, they ought to be involved in a constructive way, encouraging peace. That is the message that the Iranians\u2014the Iraqis have delivered to the Iranians. That's the message that Prime Minister Maliki has made clear, that he expects the neighbors to encourage peaceful development of the country.As far as the United States goes, Iran knows how to get to the table with us, and that is to do that which they said they would do, which is verifiably suspend their enrichment programs. One of the concerns that I have about the Iranian regime is their desire to develop a nuclear weapon, and you ought to be concerned about it too. The idea of this regime having a nuclear weapon by which they could blackmail the world is unacceptable to free nations. And that's why we're working through the United Nations to send a clear message that the EU-3 and the United States, Russia, and China do not accept their desires to have a nuclear weapon.There is a better way forward for the Iranian people. And if they would like to be at the table discussing this issue with the United States, I have made it abundantly clear how they can do so, and that is, verifiably suspend the enrichment program. And then we'll be happy to have a dialog with them.But as far as Iraq goes, the Iraqi Government is a sovereign government that is capable of handling its own foreign policies and is in the process of doing so. And they have made it abundantly clear, and I agree with them, that the Iranians and the Syrians should help, not destabilize this young democracy.Thank you. Thank you very much.",

    "My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it's not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world.And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I've done a pretty good job, that we haven't, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it.But what is certainly true is that the American people\u2014just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world\u2014are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking. Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They're looking for some means of control.And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries.And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase. But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles\u2014as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them, but also change governments if it's\u2014they're not serving them well\u2014then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue.And I think it's especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it's particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries\u2014those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization\u2014and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.And I think that can be done. But it's hard. It requires creativity. It requires effective communications. Part of what's changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information. It's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America's futures, but the direction that the world is going in. And part of what makes me most optimistic is, if you look at the attitudes of young people. Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences. They are much more comfortable with diversity. They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between us and them. They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders.So that's where the future is. But we have to create that bridge to the future. And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped to get us here. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine. Well, on the issue, first, of independence of Germany, after the time of National Socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America. The fact that we were able to enjoy European\u2014sorry, German unification is due, first and foremost, to the help of the United States of America. And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country.Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be 26 years ago. And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution. We will all have to make\u2014do more in development cooperation. It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked. Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate, which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union. We cannot stand alone with 80 million people. In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much, even though you may be economically strong. So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation. And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole.Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at\u2014and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States. Look at the European Parliament. We\u2014there are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, for\u2014who are sort of preaching policies of, well, very unfriendly policies. We have them here in Europe too. We have them here in Germany too.And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society. Look at the history of the printing press, when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had, or industrialization, what sort of consequences that had. Very often, it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this. And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a transition from agricultural societies to industrial societies.Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country. We have it in other countries. Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days\u2014trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place.But those that are\u2014belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others\u2014that is something that we cannot allow to happen. That is something that I think, at the time in the GDR\u2014at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people\u2014that was something that filled me with great joy. But the fact that these people have hijacked it certain is not something that fills me with great joy. We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people. But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so.Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard. If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult. But we are all politicians. We all know that democracy lives off change. So, in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this. It's a tough rule: Eight years, and that's it. Out goes the President, and a new one comes in. So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead. But our personal\u2014we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game. So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say. The next question will come from Margaret Brennan of CBS News.",
    "First of all, our economy is not growing as robustly as we'd like. We had positive growth in the first quarter; we'll see what happens here in the second quarter. But nevertheless, it's\u2014we're not as strong as we have been during a lot of my Presidency. And so, as you well know, Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters], we passed a stimulus bill that is now in the process of passing money back to consumers, which had a positive effect and, hopefully, will continue to have a positive effect.We're working with the Congress to get a housing bill out. We're\u2014we passed uninsurance benefits\u2014unemployment benefits\u2014excuse me. And yet we got a problem when it comes to reliance upon foreign sources of oil. For 7 years, I've been trying to get the Congress to explore for oil domestically. Now is the time, when they come back from their Fourth of July vacations, to open up ANWR and open up the Outer Continental Shelf so that we can say to the world that we will do our part in increasing supply, so that we can transition from this period of reliance upon hydrocarbons to a new period of advanced technologies.In terms of the dollar, the United States strongly believes in a strong dollar policy and believes that our\u2014the strength of our economy will be reflected in the dollar.",

We're a transatlantic partnership. That's what I've said. It seems that the President has answered your problems. []But I have to tell you that during this process, I met approximately\u2014President many times\u2014but I would say about 50 people from Congress and Senate. And I think the message was quite clear, quite united. And I have no reason to doubt about U.S.A. policies in the future. Let me say one more thing. We learned a hard lesson. Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history. That's why we're staying together.",
    "I want to watch. I want to see. I hope I can watch. I'm meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch. And I'll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican Senators who\u2014look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, We have George Washington, the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand. []And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know. [] He may have had some, I think, accusations made. Didn't he have a couple of things in his past? George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists. I mean, 100 percent. One hundred percent.So it really doesn't matter from their standpoint. That's why when John asked about the FBI. If the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you're going to get some votes from the Democrats. You know why? Because\u2014we all know why\u2014because it's called politics. Then, you'll probably get some votes.Okay, let's go.",

I know you're so thrilled to hear that. [] We get along very, very well, and we're working with Brazil. But we have much worse instances than Brazil.

As of now\u2014as of just a little while ago\u2014one person in Brazil. But Italy is, you know, a deeper problem.And we're checking people coming in very, very strongly from those. And at some point, we may cut that off. You know, at some point, depending on what happens, we may cut certain additional countries off, like we've had to do with China. And we hope we can open it up to China as soon as possible.And we hope the numbers we've been getting\u2014we hope the numbers that we've been getting are true on China, where it really has leveled off and started to go down, because eventually, sometime, that's going to happen.Go ahead.",
    "Julie, I think every single day I'm looking for, how can we do what we need to do better. Whether that is delivering basic services the Government provides to the American people, whether that is our capacity to work with Congress so that they're passing legislation, whether it's how we communicate with the American people about what our priorities and vision is, we are constantly asking ourselves questions about how do we make sure that we're doing a better job. And that's not going to stop. I think that every election is a moment for reflection, and I think that everybody in this White House is going to look and say, all right, what do we need to do differently?But the principles that we're fighting for, the things that motivate me every single day and motivate my staff every day, those things aren't going to change. There's going to be a consistent focus on how do we deliver more opportunity to more people in this country, how do we grow the economy faster, how do we put more people back to work.And I maybe have a naive confidence that if we continue to focus on the American people and not on our own ambitions or image or various concerns like that, that at the end of the day, when I look back, I'm going to be able to say the American people are better off than they were before I was President. And that's my most important goal.So\u2014but the other thing I just want to emphasize is I'm\u2014I've said this before, I want to reiterate it: If there are ideas that the Republicans have that I have confidence will make things better for ordinary Americans, the fact that the Republicans suggesting it as opposed to a Democrat, that will be irrelevant to me. I want to just see what works.And there are some things like rebuilding our infrastructure or early childhood education that we know works. And I'm hoping that the kind of attitude and approach that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have already expressed, their desire to get things done, allows us to find some common ground.Jeff Mason [Reuters].",
    "Here's what I think. I think that in this day and age, there are going to be--there is always going to be the potential for an individual or a small group of individuals, if they are willing to die, to kill other people. Some of them are going to be very well organized, and some of them are going to be random. That threat is there. And it's important, I think, for the American people to understand that and not to live in fear. It's just a reality of today's world that there are going to be threats out there.We have, I think, greatly improved our homeland security since 9/11 occurred. I am constantly impressed with the dedication that our teams apply to this problem. They are chasing down every thread, not just from Al Qaida, but any other actor out there that might be engaging in terrorism. They are making sure that even a--what might appear to be a lone individual who has very little organizational capacity--if they make a threat, they follow up.But one of the things that I want to make sure we do as long as I'm President and beyond my Presidency is to understand America's strength in part comes from its resilience, and that we don't start losing who we are or overreacting if, in fact, there is the threat of terrorism out there.We go about our business. We are tougher than them. Our families and our businesses and our churches and mosques and synagogues and our Constitution, our values, that's what gives us strength. And we are going to have this problem out there for a long time to come. But it doesn't have to completely distort us. And it doesn't have to dominate our foreign policy. What we can do is to constantly fight against it. And I think ultimately we are going to be able to stamp it out. But it's going to take some time.White House Press Secretary Robert L. Gibbs.

    "Well these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today we did Central Bank as you know. And we'll see. We'll see.They're having a lot of problems not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.We are by far the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds but plenty of time. Plenty of time.In the meantime they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say Oh you should go in immediately. And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States what's good for our allies. And it's working out really very well.As far as Robert is concerned he's\u2014Robert maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing I find with hostages. It's really something.I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family an incredible family\u2014the whole family and some of Otto's friends in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto\u2014really in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.The First Lady and I it was very\u2014you know it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.You've got to move fast. With hostages you have to move fast. All of a sudden it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes it's just too late. In the case of Otto it was very late. We got him home but he was in horrible horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well\u2014I actually work hard on hostages I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that but I do. These are great\u2014I guess in almost all cases\u2014American lives. And we help other people also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation where we have some strength that they don't.But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt\u2014we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home who\u2014our great pastor who everyone in this room knows and loves.But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position\u2014it's a very critical time\u2014I had so many people\u2014I shouldn't say this in front of Robert he'll be embarrassed but I had so many people that called me and they recommended Robert O'Brien. So I think he's going to do a great job.And he was here\u2014I can tell you this\u2014he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.",
    "Now, let me ask the lastanswer the last question first. Then, yes. The answer is yes for me. So let me continue with my answers to your question.Now, the Korean Peninsula trust-building process, basically, we have this principle: Now, we will be very sternly and decisively dealing with any provocations, but we're also leaving the door open for a dialogue, and we'll continue to make efforts to build trust. So this is the basic principle, and this is the basic underlying foundation of all our North Korean policies.In August, there was a North Korean provocation in the demilitarized zone, and we stuck to this principle and applied it to the situation. And we were very firmly responding to the situation, and as a result, we were able to reach the August 25 agreement between the two Koreas.So we had this vicious cycle where North Korea kept on provoking us, and then we just rewarded it, and it went on and on. And we want to stop this. And we are very clear that our North Korean policy line will not change just because North Korea continues to provoke and threaten us. Now, the Korean Government will try to smoothly implement the August 25 agreement. And we seek to put into place concrete measures for reconciliation and cooperation in an effort to maintain this momentum for improved inter-Korean ties.Now, in the past, some peopleyou might have thought that, well, if you just let thingssome things slide, won't you get along better? But if you look at the results of that attitude, they really weren't very good. We need a principled approach, and this principled approach might make it difficult for the time beingthe immediate time beingbut that is where improved relationships will actually start. That is my belief.Now, reunification is something that no one can really predict. Now, in the summit earlier too, we talked about Germany and how the Chancellor Kohl said that German reunification would happen in 10 years' time, but then 3 days later, the Berlin Wall came falling down. So it's really something that's very unpredictable. But no matter when it happens, for us, we need to be prepared. I think that is the most important point for us. So for any circumstances, we need to be prepared. And we are making efforts in this regard.Now, we do have reunification preparation committee that are looking into the practical aspects of reunification, how we prepare for it. But reunification is actually not just between South and North Korea, it also affects the greater international community. So we need to also look at our neighboring countries, and we need to create an environment throughout the world where there is consensus that people agree that, yes, reunification is needed and this will be good for the region, for peace and prosperity. And we need to be able to tell our neighbors and the greater world that reunification is a good thing for the region and the world. And we will continue to make efforts in this regard as well. . I was impressed the first time I met with President Park and just have become more and more impressed with her leadership, the clarity of her vision. And she has not only been a great partner to us, but I think has helped to continue Korea's broader role in global affairs. And so I'm very proud to be working with her, and I think our strong relationship is also a reflection of the extraordinary friendship and close relationship between the American people and the Korean people.Carol Lee [Wall Street Journal].

    "Well, I'm not prepared to do that in detail, in terms of the Executive orders I may be able to engage in and other things I can do. But one of\u2014the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts\u2014in our view\u2014unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.We have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.If I had talked to you\u2014not you; I'm using you in a total sense. If I had talked to the public about the whole idea of subversion of elections by deciding who the electors are after the fact, I think people would've looked at me like, Whoa.I mean, I caught\u2014taught constitutional law for 20 years\u2014a three-credit course on the separation of powers. And\u2014on Saturday mornings, when I was a Senator. And I never thought we'd get into a place where we were talking about being able to actually\u2014what they tried to do this last time out is send different electors to the State legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win, but a Republican candidate won. I doubt that anybody thought that would ever happen in America in the 21st century, but it's happening.And so I think\u2014I guess what I'm saying is, Nancy\u2014is that I think there are a number of things we can do, but I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of the legislation\u2014if we don't get it all now\u2014to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation, as well as the fair elections bills.",
    "Yes, it is. And, first of all, I can fully understand why people are tired of the war. The question they have is, can we win it? And of course I'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight. I believe, however, that when they really think about the consequences if we were to precipitously withdraw, they begin to say to themselves, maybe we ought to win this; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq.Their question, it seems like to me, is, can we succeed? And that's a very important, legitimate question for anybody to ask. I think many people understand we must succeed, and I think a lot of people understand we've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions. I suspect\u2014I know this, Ed, that if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war, they would be very concerned about the mission. In other words, if our troops said, Well, here we are in combat, and we've got a Commander in Chief who is running a focus group. In other words, politics would be\u2014is more important to him than our safety and/or our strategy, that would dispirit our troops.And there's a lot of constituencies in this fight. Clearly the American people, who are paying for this, is the major constituency. And I repeat to you, Ed, I understand that there\u2014this violence has affected them. And a lot of people don't think we can win. There's a lot of people in Congress who don't think we can win as well, and therefore, their attitude is, get out.My concern with that strategy\u2014something that Mike Hayden also discussed\u2014 is that just getting out may sound simple, and it may affect polls, but it would have long-term, serious security consequences for the United States. And so, Ed, sometimes you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right. My most important job is to help secure this country, and therefore, the decisions in Iraq are all aimed at helping do that job. And that's what I firmly believe.A second constituency is the military. And I repeat to you: I'm pretty confident our military do not want their Commander in Chief making political decisions about their future.A third constituency that matters to me a lot is the military families. These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices, and they support their loved ones. And I don't think they want their Commander in Chief making decisions based upon popularity.Another constituency group that is important for me to talk to is the Iraqis. Obviously, I want the Iraqi Government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation top down, that we want to see laws passed. I think they've got that message. They know full well that the American Government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together. That's what the benchmarks are aimed to do.But they also need to know that I am making decisions based upon our security interests, of course, but also helping them succeed, and that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States. What will determine the course of actions is, will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run?And finally, another constituency is the enemy, who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them. And so that's what I think about, Ed.And, you know, I guess I'm like any other political figure; everybody wants to be loved, just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved. And so when it's all said and done, Ed, when you've\u2014if you ever come down and visit the old, tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say, I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle, not based upon politics. And that's important to me.Thank you all for your time. I loved being here at this new building. Thank you.",
    "Yes. I am\u2014I believe that they're letting the American people down, is what I believe.

I mean, the act was set to expire; it did. And yet this threat hasn't gone away. And I can only\u2014it's either lack of leadership or a lack of understanding of the issue. And either way, it's not good for the country. We need to make sure our professionals have the tools to protect the American people from attack.The Colombia free trade agreement\u2014 this economy is\u2014as I mentioned to you, it's a sour time. It's tough for the American people. And yet the Colombia free trade agreement would benefit our economy. And the reason why is, is that many goods from Colombia come into our country duty free. And yet our goods going to Colombia are taxed through tariff. And the American people expect the President and the Congress to at least insist that a foreign country treat us the way we treat them. And in this case, the benefits will be more exports, more midsized and small businesses exporting into Colombia. About 9,000 exporters into Colombia today; 8,000 are midsized and small businesses. And when you can export more, it helps the economy. And one of the bright lights of the economy has been the amount of exports going overseas.So rather than playing politics or whatever rationale that they have made for Colombia, they ought to be saying, this is good for our economy, it's good for workers, it's good for small businesses.And so I'm perplexed, I guess is the best way to describe it, about why there's no action, inactivity on big issues. And because the two issues you mentioned\u2014FISA, protecting America, and Colombia, protecting America's economy by encouraging growth\u2014are important to people whether they be Republicans, Democrats, or Independents.Sheryl [Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times].",

I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have\u2014I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group\u2014I call them the consortium\u2014was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit\u2014I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay. And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies\u2014our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people\u2014work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.",
    "Whether I stopped it from happening again\u2014he knows I will take action, like we did when\u2014this last time out. What happened was: We, in fact, made it clear that we were not going to continue to allow this to go on. The end result was, we ended up withdrawing\u2014they went withdrawing Ambassadors, and we closed down some of their facilities in the United States, et cetera. And he knows there are consequences.Now, look, one of the consequences that I know\u2014I don't know; I shouldn't say this; it's unfair of me\u2014I suspect you may all think doesn't matter, but I'm confidence it matters to him\u2014confident it matters to him and other world leaders of big nations: his credibility worldwide shrinks.Let's get this straight: How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries, and everybody knew it? What would it be like if we engaged in activities that he is engaged in? It diminishes the standing of a country that is desperately trying to make sure it maintains its standing as a major world power.And so it's not just what I do, it's what the actions that other countries take\u2014in this case, \u2014that are contrary to international norms. It's the price they pay. They are not\u2014they are not\u2014able to dictate what happens in the world. There are other nations of significant consequence, i.e. the United States of America being one of them.Detention of n Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny/Syria",
    "Well, this was an extensive topic of conversation and concrete action that we're now taking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab.In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together\u2014Uganda, Ethiopia, others\u2014we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa.That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage.And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long.There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there.In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving.And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience\u2014and I shared this with \u2014is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized.And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them\u2014to their young people through social media\u2014is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful.The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society\u2014in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab\u2014that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse.Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people?If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently\u2014not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different\u2014that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's\u2014were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong.So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs\u2014[]\u2014and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. And the state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine. The state just has to say, we're going to treat everybody equally under the law. And then, everybody else can have their own opinions. All right?",
    "Well, go ahead, David. Well, first of all, on the documents, the proper process here is that the Cabinet Secretary should look back over this decision and the circumstances surrounding it, should identify those documents that should be published. It should be right that Ministers in the previous Government should be consulted about the publication of those documents. And of course we will consult with them over that.But in my view, there is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation of the circumstances surrounding this decision. I think the key thing, though, to remember is that in the end, it was a decision by the Scottish Executive.On the issue of an inquiry, as I said, I'm not currently minded to hold an inquiry because I think publishing this information, combined with the inquiry that has already been, will give people the certainty that they need about the circumstances surrounding this decision. But the key thing is to get the information out there so people can see. But I don't think there's any great mystery here. There was a decision taken by the Scottish Executive, in my view, a wholly wrong and misguided decision, a bad decision, but the decision nonetheless. That's what happened. And I don't think we need an extra inquiry to tell us that that's what happened. But the information, as I said, will be gone over and published, as appropriate. And of course I'll be consulting with previous Ministers and Prime Ministers, as you should do in the normal way. I think the simple answer is, we should have all the facts; they should be laid out there. And I have confidence that Prime Minister Cameron's government will be cooperative in making sure that the facts are there. That will not negate the fact that, as the Prime Minister indicated, it was a very poor decision and one that not only ran contrary to, I think, how we should be treating terrorists, but also didn't reflect the incredible pain that the families who were affected still suffer to this day. And my administration is in regular contact with these families, and this was a heartbreaking decision for them that reopened a whole host of new wounds.So my expectation is, is that the facts will be out there, and, as David indicated, with all the facts out, I think we're going to be back to where we are right now, which it was--it's--it was a decision that should not have been made and one that we should learn from going forward.Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].",

    "I do want to leave legacy questions to the history books. But what I can do\u2014maybe this is a fair response to your question\u2014is to say how I've tried to lead the country on this issue.More than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race; to encourage people to listen to each other; to recognize that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn't suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama; that things have gotten better\u2014substantially better\u2014but that we've still got a lot more work to do; and that, as was the case with the police Task Force that we set up, that I've tried to encourage people to come up with practical, concrete solutions that can reduce, if not eliminate, the problems of racial bias.And if my voice has been true and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them; it allows us to wrestle with these issues and try to come up with practical solutions; and that that perspective may lead to continued improvement so that not just Malia and Sasha, but their children can experience a country that is more just and more united and more equal.And that's not going to happen right away, and that's okay.

    "Okay so Turkey is an interesting case\u2014because there's another one Jim that I get along with very well and he's a tough cookie okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing but I think it's a really good thing. Because frankly he wanted to wipe out\u2014he has a big problem with the Kurds as everyone knows. And he had a 65000-man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the Kurds who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are I guess natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had\u2014they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with and I said You can't do that. You can't do it. And he didn't do it.So I have a relationship. But let me tell you\u2014so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy\u2014even though he's a member of NATO and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the President. He\u2014and he's got a big army and he's\u2014you know they're fighters. Turkey is\u2014big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed and neither do I\u2014in Syria. But\u2014and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned folks to President Putin. I said Please take it easy with Idlib. Because you know they've been encircling that.I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know getting terrorists is okay but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.So anyway\u2014so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey\u2014and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no no no. Couldn't buy it. Now he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it.So he goes out he goes to Russia and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good but he made a deal. He paid them money a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said Listen we don't want you to use that system because it's not the NATO system et cetera et cetera\u2014you know all the reasons: We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor we'll sell you the Patriot. He said It's too late. I already bought it. There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.In the meantime he bought over a hundred F-35s the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money up front to Lockheed our company our jobs everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the S-400 system Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.But honestly I'm all for our country but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it you can't buy it. You know it's the old secret when you can't have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were\u2014they said\u2014first they said: We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years. Then they said We'll get it to you immediately. But he said: I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system\u2014similar system\u2014from Russia. The problem is he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint. Not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise.So it's a mess. It's a mess. And honestly it's not really Erdogan's fault. So now we have breaking news.",
    "Well, I think that each family has got to look at its circumstances and make those determinations. Obviously, there are a lot of people who are concerned about their job security, or they're concerned about seeing their savings having diminished if they were in the stock market, and I think it's an understandable response to be somewhat cautious in the midst of this kind of uncertainty.I think the best advice I would have would be to say that despite the current hardships, we are going to get through this, and so you should plan sensibly, in anticipation that this economy is going to recover and new families, young families are going to want to buy new homes, and sooner or later that clunker of a car is going to wear out and people are going to want to buy a new car. And so that basing decisions around fear is not the right way to go.We are going to get through this difficult time. And I think it is sometimes important to step back and just have some perspective about the differences between now and the Great Depression, when there were no social safety nets in place, when unemployment was 25 or 30 percent. I mean, this is a difficult time, but it's not what happened to our grandparents' generation.And so I would ask people to be confident about their own futures. And that may mean, in some cases, spending now as investments for the future. There's been a debate back home about our budget. In the midst of this crisis, should we deal with health care? Should we deal with energy? Should we deal with education? And one of the analogies I've used is a family who is having a difficult time--and I actually get letters like this occasionally from voters--one of our parents has lost their job, savings have declined, and so I'm wrestling with whether or not I should go to college, because that will require me taking out a lot of debt, and maybe it would be more responsible for me to go find any job that I can to help the family.And, you know, when I write back to those families or those individuals I say, you've obviously got to make these decisions yourself, but don't shortchange the future because of fear in the present. And that I think is the most important message that we can send not just in the United States but around the world. Barack is absolutely right. Look, surely the most important thing is that people, by the decisions that are made, can have confidence in the future, confidence to be able to make decisions about whether to save or to spend. And all the measures that we are taking--restructuring the banks, putting money into the economy, the public works, and of course, the low-carbon activities that we're encouraging as well--are designed to give people the confidence that their savings are safe; that we've sorted out the problems and are sorting out the problems in the banking system; that we have put resources into economic activity in the economy so that jobs can be saved and jobs can be created. And then people, as consumers, can make their own decisions about what they want to do.And I think that's the key to the future, that people can see that the problems are being addressed and they themselves can have the confidence either to save or to spend or to invest, confidence in the future. And I believe that we can make a big step towards creating that confidence by some of the decisions that we can make together. All right? George. Fine.",

    "True, we have not resolved all the problems relating to missile defense and the third site in Europe. However, I have already mentioned, before and today, we have seen once again that our U.S. partners not only understand our concerns but are sincerely trying to overcome our concerns. And another important observation is that I do have certain cautious optimism with regard to mutual agreements. I believe that this is possible. But the devil is in the details, and it is important here that our experts could work at the expert level. It is important for them to agree on the concrete confidence-building measures, and they should see how those measures will be implemented in practical terms.And the third issue mentioned by President Bush\u2014he said that we should work together on these systems. It would be desirable. I believe that this is the most important thing, if, at the expert level and then at the political level, we are able to start cooperation on a global missile defense system, as we are now talking about\u2014[inaudible]\u2014missile defense in Europe. If we manage to achieve this kind of level of cooperation on a global missile defense system, this will be the best kind of result for all our proceeding efforts. Precisely what he said is true. And that is, is that if we can, first of all, earn enough trust to be able to cooperate regionally and then globally, that's in our interest, because one of the concerns from the Russian side, a clear concern, is that if they believe the system is aimed at them, they're going to obviously do something about it. They'll spend money to avoid the system.And I view this as defensive, not offense. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to convince the experts that the system is not aimed at Russia. It's really to help deal with the threats that we all are going to face. And therefore, the vision about having a global system is something I strongly support, where we're working cooperatively together.

    "Well, as I said in my opening statement, there's no doubt that Republicans had a good night. And what we're going to make sure that we do is to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who are now running both Chambers in Congress, and find out what their agenda is. And my hope is, is that they've got some specific things they want to do that correspond with some things that we want to get done. What's most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically, the last several is: Get stuff done. Don't worry about the next election. Don't worry about party affiliation. Do worry about our concerns. Worry about the fact that I'm a single mom and, at the end of the month, it's really hard for me to pay the bills, in part because I've got these huge childcare costs. Do worry about the fact that I'm a young person who's qualified to go to college, but I'm really worried about taking $50,000 a year out in debt, and I don't know how I'd pay that back. Do worry about the fact that I'm a construction worker who has been working all my life, and I know that there's construction work that should be done, but right now, for some reason, projects are stalled. If we're thinking about those folks, I think we're, hopefully, going to be able to get some stuff done.In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we're attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks who've lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but aren't properly documented\u2014give them a chance to pay their back taxes, get in the back of the line, but get through a process that allows them to get legal.The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system, but our economy, and would improve business conditions here in the United States and make sure that American-born workers aren't undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren't always paid a fair wage, and as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing.So we got a bipartisan bill out of the Senate. I asked John Boehner at that point, can we pass this through the House? There's a majority of votes in the House to get this passed. And Speaker Boehner, I think, was sincere about wanting to pass it, but had difficulty over the last year trying to get it done.So when he finally told me he wasn't going to call it up this year, what I indicated to him is, I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away.That's a commitment I made not just to the American people and to businesses and the evangelical community and law enforcement folks and everybody who's looked at this issue and thinks that we need immigration reform; that's a commitment that I also made to John Boehner, that I would act in the absence of action by Congress.So before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border, where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern. And at the same time, I'll be reaching out to both Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and other Republican as well as Democratic leaders to find out how it is that they want to proceed. And if they want to get a bill done, whether it's during the lame duck or next year, I'm eager to see what they have to offer.But what I'm not going to do is just wait. I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I'm going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let's figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.",
    "Could I just say that Chuck's the only guy who asked two questions so far. So just--when I cut off here, whoever was next in the queue--[]--I'm messing with you, Chuck.With respect to the supercommittee, in August we negotiated to initiate a trillion dollars in cuts over the next 10 years, primarily out of discretionary spending, but we also said that in order for us to move towards a more stable fiscal condition that we're going to have to get an additional 1.2, minimum. I actually argued that we needed more than that. And the whole idea of the sequester was to make sure that both sides felt obligated to move off rigid positions and do what was required to help the country.And since that time, they've had a lot of conversations, but it feels as if people continue to try to stick with their rigid positions rather than solve the problem.Now, I've put forward a very detailed approach that would achieve $3 trillion-plus in savings. And it's the sort of balanced approach that the American people prefer. It says everything's on the table. We've got to have discretionary spending cuts of the sort we've already put in place. We've got to have nondefense cuts. We've got to have defense cuts. We're going to have to look at entitlement programs. We've got to reduce our health care costs. And we're going to need additional revenue.And when we're talking about revenue, if we've got to raise money, it makes sense for us to start by asking the wealthiest among us to pay a little bit more before we start asking seniors, for example, to pay a lot more for their Medicare.Now, this is the same presentation that I made to Speaker Boehner back in August. It's the same kind of balanced approach that every single independent committee that's looked at this has said needs to be done. And it just feels as if people keep on wanting to jigger the math so that they get a different outcome.Well, the equation, no matter how you do it, is going to be the same. If you want a balanced approach that doesn't gut Medicare and Medicaid, doesn't prevent us from making investments in education and basic science and research--all the things we've been talking about here at APEC, that every world leader understands is the key for long-term economic success--then prudent cuts have to be matched up with revenue.My hope is that over the next several days, the congressional leadership on the supercommittee go ahead and bite the bullet and do what needs to be done, because the math won't change. There's no magic formula. There are no magic beans that you can toss on the ground, and suddenly, a bunch of money grows on trees. We got to just go ahead and do the responsible thing. And I'm prepared to sign legislation that is balanced, that solves this problem.One other thing that I want to say about this: When I meet with world leaders, what's striking--whether it's in Europe or here in Asia--the kinds of fundamental reforms and changes both on the revenue side and the public pension side that other countries are having to make are so much more significant than what we need to do in order to get our books in order.This doesn't require radical changes to America or its way of life. It just means that we spread out the sacrifice across every sector so that it's fair, so that people don't feel as if once again people who are well connected, people who have lobbyists, special interests get off easy, and the burden is placed on middle class families that are already struggling. So if other countries can do it, we can do it, and we can do it in a responsible way.I'm not going to comment on whether I'd veto a particular bill until I actually see a bill, because I still hold out the prospect that there's going to be a light-bulb moment where everybody says: Aha! Here's what we've got to do.With respect to the hot mike in France, I'm not going to comment on conversations that I have with individual leaders, but what I will say is this: The primary conversation I had with President Sarkozy in that meeting revolved around my significant disappointment that France had voted in favor of the Palestinians joining UNESCO, knowing full well that under our laws, that would require the United States cutting off funding to UNESCO, and after I had consistently made the argument that the only way we're going to solve the Middle East situation is if Palestinians and Israelis sit down at the table and negotiate, that it is not going to work to try to do an end run through the United Nations.So I had a very frank and firm conversation with President Sarkozy about that issue. And that is consistent with both private and public statements that I've been making to everybody over the last several months.Ed Henry [FOX News].",
    "Well, I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security.Obviously, there's an ongoing investigation. I don't want to comment on the specifics of the investigation. The FBI has its own protocols in terms of how they proceed, and I'm going to let Director Mueller and others examine those protocols and make some statements to the public generally.I do want to emphasize what I've said before: General Petraeus had an extraordinary career. He served this country with great distinction in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and as head of the CIA. By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as the Director of CIA with respect to this personal matter that he is now dealing with with his family and with his wife. And it's on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and it's on that basis that I accepted it.But I want to emphasize that, from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service. We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done. And my main hope right now is, is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career.",
    "So, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests.

    "Well, a couple of things. Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class. So if you set aside budget fights for a second, we've been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done. The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward. We've seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education. There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence.And what I'm going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families. And we won't get everything done all at once, but we can get a lot done. So that's point number one.With respect to the budget, what I've done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy. And part of the challenge that we've had here is that not only Congress, but, I think, Washington generally spends all its time talking about deficits and doesn't spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs. So I want to make sure that we're talking about both.I think that, for example, we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges. And this is deferred maintenance. We know we're going to have to do it. And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell's State to John Boehner's State, and it was a rotten bridge, and everybody knows it. And I'll bet they really want to see that improved. Well, how do we do it? Let's have a conversation about it. That will create jobs. It will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety. That has to be part of this conversation, not just this constant argument about cutting and spending.So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we're constantly focused, that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed. Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part. But it's not the only part. And I don't want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing.And as I already said to Jessica, what I'm also hoping is, is that, over time\u2014perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say, you know what, we stuck tough on the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the Republican Caucus is in a better mood when they come back\u2014maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.And the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck, and you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people pretty steadily are commonsense and practical, and eventually, that commonsense, practical approach wins out. And I think that's what will happen here as well.And in the meantime, just to make the final point about the sequester, we will get through this. This is not going to be a apocalypse, I think, as some people have said. It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt individual people, and it's going to hurt the economy overall.But if Congress comes to its senses a week from now, a month from now, 3 months from now, then there's a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically. And so I\u2014this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness.Thank you very much. All right?",

Plus, they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished.",
    "You know, I should have brought this up. I do. I think we have a good chance. And thank you. It's an important issue, and I hope we can get something done on it. I meant to put that in my list of things that we need to get done.I would hope Republicans have recognized that we've taken very strong security measures to address one aspect of comprehensive immigration reform. And I was talking to Secretary Chertoff today; he thinks that these measures we're taking are beginning to have measurable effects and that catch-and-release has virtually been ended over the last couple of months. And that's positive.And that's what some Members were concerned about prior to advancing a comprehensive bill. In other words, they said, Show me progress on the border, and then we'll be interested in talking about other aspects. Well, there's progress being made on the border, in terms of security, and I would hope we can get something done. It's a vital issue. It's an issue that\u2014there's an issue where I believe we can find some common ground with the Democrats.",
    "Well, first of all, I don't agree with your premise that there's no politics taking place in Iraq. There is a functioning Government.

It took our Congress till the last minute to get things done. I mean, the legislative process is not all that smooth at times. And they've got a lot of work to do; don't get me wrong. I mean, I am not suggesting that we shouldn't, as a Government, continue to press them. What I am suggesting, though, there is a functioning Government. Your statement was, security didn't provide room for a government to stand up and function. Well, it's happening. And so therefore\u2014 and therefore, we will continue to press them on de-Ba'ath law, Provincial election laws, power sharing with the central Government and the Provinces, and oil law.But as I've reminded you from this podium, they are distributing oil revenues to the Provinces. There is revenue sharing, and there's local reconciliation taking place. And a lot of times, it's local politics that will drive national politics. Are we satisfied with the progress in Baghdad? No. But to say nothing is happening is just simply not the case.",

    "You stuffed a lot in there, April. [] You know what?",
    "Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my Presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the President and the Government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.I think it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the Presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do, that return to an adversarial spirit that, I think, existed during the cold war has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine.The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn't our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms.What I've said to the Russians is, as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don't confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.On nuclear issues, in my first term, we negotiated the START II Treaty, and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there is\u2014remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we've been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example.I hope that continues. But I think it's important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country.And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it's advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women's rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.The United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting\u2014in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7\u2014the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.Kevin Corke [Fox News].",
    "Sure. First of all, Presidents don't recruit; the people elect a leader with whom I will work. And I had a\u2014 I did talk to President-elect Sarkozy; I think it was at about 8:03 Paris time.

I had met with him before when he came over here and found him to be a very engaging, energetic, smart, capable person. We will have our differences, and we will have our agreements. And I'm looking forward to working with him.Vice President Cheney is in the Middle East. His first message to the Iraqis was that they have got to speed up their clock, that\u2014I agree with General Petraeus's assessment that there are two clocks: one ticking here in Washington and one ticking there. And they must understand that we are very serious when it comes to them passing law that enables this country to more likely reconcile. And then he'll be traveling to talk to other friends in the area.One of the questions that many ask is, do we understand the Iranian issue well? Do we understand the consequences of Iran having a nuclear weapon\u2014which it looks like they want to try to achieve\u2014 to get. And the answer is, absolutely. And they'll find a stalwart friend in dealing with extremism in that vital part of the world. And that\u2014Vice President will lay out our strategy of convincing others to join us in\u2014 on this Iranian issue. He will point out to them that we have worked hard to convince not only the EU-3 to join with the United States in sending a clear message but also now Russia and China, and that we do have a diplomatic front. And we've got to work\u2014to continue to work together. We've got to work to keep it together, to send a focused, concerted message.He will also remind people that success in Iraq will be important for dealing with Iran, that if we were to listen to some of the voices in Congress and withdraw before the job was done, it would embolden Iran. In other words, there are strategic consequences to what is being said here in Washington, DC, about the Iraqi issue.And so he's got to\u2014it's a vital trip, and I really appreciate him going.

    "Yes. It's not a mass send, but it's sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It's not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which, as an example, a lot of progress has been made in Portland. But you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again.This is\u2014these are Democrat-run cities and States, and it hasn't been a pretty picture to watch. We will help Chicago. We'll help New York, if they request. They have to request the help, but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and\u2014but what it is, is drug related, gang related. Largely gang related.With ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13\u2014thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or, in some cases, have to put them in prison. They're too violent.

    "Well, on the latter question, I'm not going to hypothesize about not getting it done. I intend to get it done. And, hopefully, we're going to get a vote soon, because I think it's the right thing to do.With respect to ISIL, we have made significant progress in pushing back ISIL from areas in which they had occupied or disrupted local populations, but we've also seen areas like in Ramadi where they're displaced in one place and then they come back in, in another. And they're nimble, and they're aggressive, and they're opportunistic. So one of the areas where we're going to have to improve is the speed at which we're training Iraqi forces. Where we've trained Iraqi forces directly and equipped them and we have a train-and-assist posture, they operate effectively. Where we haven't, morale, lack of equipment, et cetera, may undermine the effectiveness of Iraqi security forces. So we want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well equipped, and focused. And President Abadi wants the same thing.So we're reviewing a range of plans for how we might do that, essentially accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that are properly trained and equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership. And when a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American people. It's not\u2014I\u2014we don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place.

    "There is no doubt that the Speaker has challenges in his caucus, and I recognize that. I'm often reminded when I speak to the Republican leadership that the majority of their caucus's membership come from districts that I lost. All right? And so sometimes, they may not see an incentive in cooperating with me, in part because they're more concerned about challenges from a Tea Party candidate or challenges from the right, and cooperating with me may make them vulnerable. I recognize that.But, goodness, if this past week has done anything, it should just give us some perspective. If there's one thing we should have after this week, it should be a sense of perspective about what's important. And I would like to think that members of their\u2014that caucus would say to themselves: You know what, we disagree with the President on a whole bunch of things. We wish the other guy had won. We're going to fight him on a whole range of issues over the next 4 years. We think his philosophy is all screwed up. But right now what the country needs is for us to compromise, get a deficit reduction deal in place, make sure middle class taxes don't go up, make sure that we're laying the foundations for growth, give certainty to businesses large and small, not put ourselves through some sort of self-inflicted crisis every 6 months, allow ourselves time to focus on things like preventing the tragedy in Newtown from happening again, focus on issues like energy, immigration reform, and all the things that will really make a determination as to whether our country grows over the next 4 years, 10 years, 40 years.And if you just pull back from the immediate political battles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be able to get something done.And I think the Speaker would like to get that done. I think an environment needs to be created within not just the House Republican Caucus, but also among Senate Republicans that say, the campaign is over and let's see if we can do what's right for the country, at least for the next month. And then, we can reengage in all the other battles that they'll want to fight.",
    "No, I didn't tell him anything. I said, What happened? And I got the impression that he didn't realize he said what he might have said. I didn't see him say it.",
    "Yes. Look, this is a common theme that folks bring up. Apparently, people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world. And so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards. That's been true in the Middle East. That's been true in Europe. That's been true in Asia. That's the nature of world affairs. It's not neat, and it's not smooth.But if you look at, for example, Ukraine, we have made progress in delivering on what we said we would do. We can't control how Mr. Putin thinks. But what we can do is say to Mr. Putin, if you continue on the path of arming separatists with heavy armaments that, the evidence suggests, may have resulted in 300 innocent people on a jet dying, and that violates international law and undermines the integrity\u2014territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, then you're going to face consequences that will hurt your country.And there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to coordinate with Europeans for a strong series of sanctions. And each time, we have done what we said we would do, including this week, when we put in place sanctions that have an impact on key sectors of the Russian economy: their energy, their defense, and their financial systems.It hasn't resolved the problem yet. I spoke to Mr. Putin this morning, and I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we'll also do what we say we do in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position. If he respects and honors the right of Ukrainians to determine their own destiny, then it's possible to make sure that Russian interests are addressed that are legitimate and that Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions and we can resolve this conflict and end some of the bloodshed.But the point is, though, Bill, that if you look at the 20th century and the early part of this century, there are a lot of conflicts that America doesn't resolve. That's always been true. That doesn't mean we stop trying. And it's not a measure of American influence on any given day or at any given moment that there are conflicts around the world that are difficult. The conflict in Northern Ireland raged for a very, very long time until finally something broke, where the parties decided that it wasn't worth killing each other.The Palestinian-Israeli conflicts has been going on even longer than you've been reporting. [] And I don't think at any point was there a suggestion somehow that America didn't have influence just because we weren't able to finalize an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. You will recall that situations like Kosovo and Bosnia raged on for quite some time, and there was a lot more death and bloodshed than there has been so far in the Ukrainian situation before it ultimately did get resolved.And so I recognize, with so many different issues popping up around the world, sometimes, it may seem as if this is an aberration or it's unusual. But the truth of the matter is, is that this is a big world out there and that as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, there's still going to be tragedies out there and there are going to be conflicts. And our job is to just make sure that we continue to project what's right, what's just, and that we're building coalitions of like-minded countries and partners in order to advance not only our core security interests, but also the interests of the world as a whole.",

    "You know, I really haven't\u2014I'm still going to try to speak plainly about what I think are the important priorities of the country, and winning this war on terror is, by far, the most important priority. And making sure this economy continues to grow is an important priority. And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority.Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats.And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat\u2014which goes to show I should not try punditry\u2014is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy\u2014 the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war.And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree\u2014didn't agree with some of my decisions.

    "I do have confidence in Attorney General Al Gonzales. I talked to him this morning, and we talked about his need to go up to Capitol Hill and make it very clear to members in both political parties why the Justice Department made the decisions it made, making very clear about the facts. And he's right: Mistakes were made. And I'm frankly not happy about them, because there is a lot of confusion over what really has been a customary practice by the Presidents: U.S. attorneys and others serve at the pleasure of the President. Past administrations have removed U.S. attorneys; it's their right to do so.The Justice Department recommended a list of U.S. attorneys. I believe the reasons why were entirely appropriate. And yet this issue was mishandled to the point now where you're asking me questions about it in Mexico, which is fine. I mean, if I were you, I'd ask the same question. This is an issue that\u2014and so Al\u2014let me just say, Al was right; mistakes were made; and he's going to go up to Capitol Hill to correct them.I appreciate the fact that he's taken some action, because anytime anybody goes up to Capitol Hill, they've got to make sure they fully understand the facts and how they characterize the issue to Members of Congress. And the fact that both Republicans and Democrats feel like that there was not straightforward communication troubles me, and it troubles the Attorney General, so he took action. And he needs to continue to take action.",
    "Absolutely. I mean, what I've said is that I will talk about anything. What will happen is, we won't agree on everything. I mean, the truth is, is that the parties are pretty divided on a whole big\u2014bunch of big issues right now. Everybody understands that. And by the way, voters are divided on a lot of those issues too. And I recognize that there are some House Members, Republican House Members, where I got clobbered in the last election, and they don't get politically rewarded a lot for being seen as negotiating with me. And that makes it harder for divided Government to come together.But I am willing to work through all those issues. The only thing that our democracy can't afford is a situation where one side says, unless I get my way and only my way, unless I get concessions before we even start having a serious give-and-take, I'll threaten to shut down the Government or I will threaten to not pay America's bills.So I will not eliminate any topic of conversation. And I've shown myself willing to engage all the parties involved, every leader, on any issue.",
    "One of the great things about our democracy is, it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting. I've been the subject of protests during the course of my 8 years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign\u2014I wouldn't advise them to be silent.What I would advise\u2014what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election\u2014is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter. And what I consistently say to young people\u2014I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe\u2014do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life.I think there is a tendency\u2014because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up\u2014there is a tendency, I think, to assume that that's always the case. And it's not. Democracy is hard work.In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not\u2014and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones\u2014if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there's an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks.It's hard work. And the good news is, I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward.But I do think sometimes there's complacency. Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the cold war, who forget what it meant to have a wall. And I'll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where an easy equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate\u2014where those distinctions aren't made. I've said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws; we've operated imperfectly. There are times when we've made mistakes. There are times where I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with. It's a work of constant improvement.But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties and an independent judiciary and fighting corruption, those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country, but also with respect to our foreign policy.And that should be remembered. Because at an age where there's so much active misinformation\u2014and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television\u2014where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And you\u2014we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.That was a long answer, wasn't it? I don't remember if I\u2014there was a second part to it. I was\u2014I got all caught up in that one [].",
    "Well, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It\u2014called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates\u2014what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors. That's why AARP has endorsed us. Okay.Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune].",

    "Well, I think we have to look at it very seriously if that's the case, and I think we will. There's nobody been tougher on Russia than I have. We get along. I get along with almost all countries.I get along with North Korea. Remember? We were supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. That would be a very messy war, a very bad war. Many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I'd be at war in 1 week; it's been just the opposite.We're doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down\u2014very low level\u2014and other things are happening. Very interestingly, we have a great peace deal going on in the Middle East, actually, with U.A.E. and Israel. And that's been received like, probably, very few things that many people have done. It's been very well received. And we'll be having other countries announcing soon; they're joining that, and you're going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, Hey, why didn't you bring us in right from the beginning? They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in.So we're doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world: Nord Stream 2. I said: Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia, and then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia? What's that all about? And the sanctions and everything else.At the same time, with Russia, we're right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It's a very important thing. To me, it's the most important thing. Some people say global warming; I don't. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest; they are the second biggest, nuclear-wise. China is third. They're actually a distant third, but they're building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we'll include China into those talks, but we're doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation.So I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic. It's terrible. It shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet, but I will take a look.",
    "First, let me talk about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A lot of people in the country probably don't understand how important they are to the mortgage markets. And it's really important for people to have confidence in the mortgage markets and that there be stability in the mortgage markets. And that's why Secretary Paulson announced the plan this weekend, which says that he needs authorities from the Congress to come up with a line of credit for these institutions, if needed, and that he ought to have the authority to invest capital, if needed.And so the purpose was to send a clear signal that, one, we understand how important these institutions are to the mortgage markets, and two, to kind of calm nerves. The truth of the matter is, by laying this out, it is\u2014makes it less likely we'll need to use this kind of authority to begin with, which, by the way, is temporary authority.As you\u2014talked about banks. Now, if you're a commercial bank in America and your deposit\u2014and you have a deposit in a commercial bank in America, your deposit is insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. And so therefore, when you hear nervousness about your bank, you know, people start talking about how nervous they are about your bank's condition, the depositor must understand that the Federal Government, through the FDIC, stands behind the deposit up to $100,000. And therefore\u2014which leads me to say that if you're a depositor, you're in\u2014you're protected by the Federal Government.I happened to have witnessed a bank run in Midland, Texas, one time. I'll never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying, Your deposits are good. We got you insured. You don't have to worry about it if you got less than $100,000 in the bank. The problem was, people didn't hear. And there's a\u2014became a nervousness. My hope is, is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our Government.So these are two different instances, mortgage markets on the one hand, banking on the other.",

    "Very well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace\u2014to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.",
    "Well, first of all, let's take a look at what we've already done. My first priority obviously was getting out American citizens and Embassy personnel out of Libya, and we got that done. The very next day, we had already instituted the largest financial seizure of assets in our history. And the day after that, we'd imposed sanctions and we had mobilized the international community through the United Nations so that across the board we are slowly tightening the noose on Qadhafi. He is more and more isolated internationally, both through sanctions as well as an arms embargo.In addition to that, we've provided a host of humanitarian aid measures to make sure that people are not adversely affected as they cross the borders into Tunisia or Egypt. And we will continue to do that.And what we've done is we've organized in NATO a series of conversations about a wide range of options that we can take, everything from 24-hour surveillance so that we can monitor the situation on the ground and react rapidly if conditions deteriorated, to further efforts with respect to an arms embargo, additional efforts on humanitarian aid, but also potential military options including a no-fly zone.NATO will be meeting on Tuesday to consider a no-fly zone, and we've been in discussions with both Arab countries as well as African countries to gauge their support for such an action.In addition, Secretary Hillary Clinton will be meeting with the opposition in the next several days, and we have determined that it's appropriate for us to assign a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them. And so we're going to be in close consultation with them.So the bottom line is, is that I have not taken any options off the table at this point. I think it is important to understand that we have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions on Qadhafi. I am absolutely clear that it is in the interest of the United States and, more importantly, in the interest of the Libyan people for Mr. Qadhafi to leave. And I have not foreclosed these options.Now, I do take very seriously making sure that any decisions I make that involve U.S. military power are well thought through and are done in close consultation with Secretary Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, and all relevant personnel. Any time I send the United States forces into a potentially hostile situation, there are risks involved and there are consequences. And it is my job as President to make sure that we have considered all those risks.It's also important, from a political perspective, to, as much as possible, maintain the strong international coalition that we have right now.",
    "I think there are real opportunities to get things done in Congress. As I said before, I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done. I think the American people would like to see us get some things done. The question is going to be, are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree? I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree.If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no. And I'm confident that I'll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions. But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done.I've never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren't for the executive actions, they would have been more productive. There's no evidence of that. So I intend to continue to do what I've been doing, which is, where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I'm going to do it. And I will then, side by side, reach out to Members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let's work together; I'd rather do it with you.Immigration is the classic example. I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you'd like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you. Ultimately, it wasn't forthcoming.And so the question is going to be, I think, if executive actions on areas like minimum wage or equal pay or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is, pass bills. And work with me to make sure I'm willing to sign those bills.Because both sides are going to have to compromise. On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I'm going to have sign off. And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I'm going to have to take into account the issues that they care about.All right. I think this is going to be our last question. Juliet Alsprin [Juliet Eilperin, Washington Post].",
    "Today. Yes, we had it made up by some\u2014I hope you liked it. I thought it was good. I thought it was interesting enough to show, one in English and one in Korean. And we had it made up.

    "I think it's hard to say. It's interesting, I spoke at the LBJ Library the other day, and most of us weren't around to pay real close attention to those debates, or they're pretty distant now in the past. Apparently, it took several years before people realized, hey, Medicare actually works, and it's lifting a lot of seniors out of despair and poverty.So we've been through this cycle before. It happens each and every time we make some strides in terms of strengthening our commitments to each other and we expand some of these social insurance programs.There's a lot of fear-mongering and a lot of political argument and debate, and a lot of accusations are flung back and forth about socialized medicine and the end of freedom. And then it turns out that, you know what, it's working for a lot of folks, and we still live in a free-market society, and the Constitution is intact. And then we move on. And I don't know how long it's going to take. But in the meantime, how about us focusing on some things that the American people really care about? All right?Thank you, everybody.",
    "Well, I'm not going to discuss the specific exchanges that we've had. But we've been very firm about this being an important priority. Okay?Ed Henry [CNN].",
    "Well, first of all, as I said, this is a cause for deep concern but not panic. And I think that we have to make sure that we recognize that how we respond--intelligently, systematically, based on science and what public health officials have to say--will determine in large part what happens.I've consulted with our public health officials extensively on a day-to-day basis, in some cases, an hour-to-hour basis. At this point, they have not recommended a border closing. From their perspective it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out, because we already have cases here in the United States. We have ramped up screening efforts as well as made sure that additional supplies are there on the border so that we can prepare in the eventuality that we have to do more than we're doing currently.But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain we don't yet know how it will respond. So we have to take additional precautions, essentially, take out some additional insurance. Now, that's why I asked for an additional $1.5 billion, so that we can make sure that everything is in place should a worst-case scenario play out.I do want to compliment Democrats and Republicans who worked diligently back in 2005 when the bird flu came up. I was part of a group of legislators who worked with the Bush administration to make sure that we had beefed up our infrastructure and our stockpiles of antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. And I think the Bush administration did a good job of creating the infrastructure so that we can respond. For example, we've got 50 million courses of antiviral drugs in the event that they're needed.So the Government is going to be doing everything that we can. We're coordinating closely with State and local officials. Secretary Napolitano at Department of Homeland Security, newly installed Secretary Sebelius of Health and Human Services, our Acting CDC Director, they are all on the phone on a daily basis with all public health officials across the States to coordinate and make sure that there's timely reporting, that if as new cases come up that we are able to track them effectively, that we're allocating resources so that they're in place.The key now, I think, is to make sure that we are maintaining great vigilance, that everybody responds appropriately when cases do come up, and individual families start taking very sensible precautions that can make a huge difference. So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference. If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane. Don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus.So those are the steps that I think we need to take right now. But understand that because this is a new strain, we have to be cautious. If this was a strain that we were familiar with, then we might have to--then I think we wouldn't see the kind of alert levels that we're seeing, for example, with the World Health Organization. Okay?Deb Price of Detroit News. Where's Deb? Good to see you.",
    "You know, I meet with a lot of people on the subject of Iraq, and I should. There's a lot of opinions on both sides of the aisle about this issue. And my message to the Members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let's make sure our troops get funded, and let's make sure politicians don't tell our commanders how to conduct operations. Let's don't hamstring our people in the field. That's my message.Their message to me has been, you know, don't you think the Iraqi Government ought to do more? They recognize what I recognize, and these gentlemen up here particularly recognize: that without political progress, it's going to be hard to achieve a military victory in Iraq. In other words, the military can provide security so a political process can go forward.Look, the two questions you asked: One was about General Petraeus's report to the\u2014back\u2014around September about what's taking place in Baghdad. My attitude toward Congress is, why don't you wait and see what he says? Fund the troops, and let him come back and report to the American people. General Petraeus picked this date. He believes that there will be enough progress one way or the other to be able to report to the American people, to give an objective assessment about what he sees regarding the Baghdad security plan.It's at that point in time that I'm confident that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs will take a look at what David Petraeus says and make recommendations about troop levels based upon the conditions on the ground, which stands in stark contrast to Members of Congress who say, we're going to determine troop levels based upon politics or the latest opinion poll or how we can get our Members elected.And the second part of your question was about benchmarks. Look, let me talk about this recent effort by Congress to fund our troops. The idea that the House of Representatives put forward is one that we will fund our troops by piecemeal. Secretary Gates was very strong about why that's a bad idea. And the American people must understand that if you fund our troops every 2 months, you're in a\u2014put in a position where we have to delay certain procurement, or that military contracts must be delayed. There's a lot of uncertainty in funding when it comes to 2-month cycles. So we reject that idea. It won't work.I find it odd that the Congress is\u2014I find it ironic that the Congress is ready to fully fund unrelated domestic spending items and only one-half of the money requested for our troops. They provide 100 percent of the money for the special interest projects that\u2014they don't have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, and 50 percent of the money to go to those who wear our uniform. They got it wrong. They ought to provide 100 percent of the money for people who wear the uniform and leave these special pork projects out of the bill. The\u2014and so I'll veto the bill if it's this haphazard, piecemeal funding. And I made that clear.One message I have heard from people from both parties and\u2014is that the idea of benchmarks makes sense. And I agree. It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward. And so I've empowered Josh Bolten to find common ground on benchmarks, and he will continue to have dialog with both Republicans and Democrats.You know, this bill\u2014I believe we can get a good supplemental, and I hope it's as quick as possible. The first blush is the bad supplemental coming out of the House. Nevertheless, there is\u2014the Senate will have a say, and then there will be a conference committee, and hopefully, we can move a good bill forward as quickly as possible. These gentlemen will tell you that the longer we wait, the more it hurts our military and the families.Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters].",

    "Thanks, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. I've heard those allegations about political decisionmaking; it's just not true. Secondly, just so you know, I get asked\u2014I mean, I get complaints all the time from Members of Congress on a variety of subjects\u2014this Senator, this Congressperson so-and-so\u2014and there's occasionally frustration with the executive branch. And they will pull me aside and say, Are you aware of this? Are you aware of that? And I did receive complaints about U.S. attorneys.I specifically remember one time I went up to the Senate, and Senators were talking about the U.S. attorneys. I don't remember specific names being mentioned, but I did say to Al last year\u2014you're right, last fall, I said, Have you heard complaints about AGs? I have\u2014I mean, U.S. attorneys, excuse me\u2014and he said, I have. But I never brought up a specific case nor gave him specific instructions.",
    "Yes, thanks. A couple of points: One, that I understand the Congress is going to express their opinion, and it's very clear where the Democrats are, and some Republicans; I know that. They didn't like the decision I made. And by the way, that doesn't mean that I think that they're not good, honorable citizens of the country\u2014just have a different opinion. I considered some of their opinions and felt like it would not lead to a country that could govern itself, sustain itself, and be an ally in the war on terror\u2014one.Secondly, my hope, however, is that this nonbinding resolution doesn't try to turn into a binding policy that prevents our troops from doing that which I have asked them to do. That's why I keep reminding people, on the one hand, you vote for David Petraeus in a unanimous way, and then the other hand, you say that you're not going to fund the strategy that he thought was necessary to do his job, a strategy he testified to in front of the Senate. I'm going to make it very clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops, and they need to make sure we have the flexibility necessary to get the job done.Secondly, I find it interesting that there is a declaration about a plan that they have not given a chance to work. Again, I understand; I understand. The other part of your question?",

We certainly don't expect that gas to be earmarked for any kind of specific market. We are believers in free trade. We don't want that to be the case. It's good news, and it's up to the American President to confirm it, but I think I can say it here that there is potential still\u2014that's what the President just told us\u2014even to increase more of these licenses.

    "Well, I can just tell you, my relationship with the leader of Great Britain has been unbelievably productive, and I have enjoyed working with Tony Blair more than I could have possibly imagined.It's hard to define our relationship in sound bites or press conferences, or to\u2014 in a way that really reflects the depth of what we have done together. And so I\u2014 you know, I don't regret things about what may or may not have happened over the past 5 years. I honor a relationship that I truly believe has been laying the foundation for peace.This may not interest you, but I'll tell you anyway. I read three histories on George Washington last year. It's interesting to me that they're still analyzing the Presidency of our first President. And my attitude is, if they're still analyzing 1, 43 doesn't need to worry about it.

Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in , where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run\u2014they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in , and the diaspora could cause some real\u2014how can I say it?\u2014confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so\u2014but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.[] For 30 years, Western countries have been involved in to try to stabilize the country, to try to help the Pearl of the Antilles. And the situation is atrocious. It's affecting the security of the people of . We must take action.And we must keep the an people in the approach that we build for security. And that's why the approach that we are working on with the U.S. involves strengthening the capacity of the an National Police, bringing more peace and security and stability. This won't happen tomorrow. It will, of course, be a long process, but we will be there to support the capacity of the police in , the National Police.At the same time, part of the insecurity and instability in is because of the an elite, who have for too long benefited from the misery of the an people. They work for their own political gain, their own personal gain. And this has prevented the country from recovering. And that's why we're proceeding with sanctions. We will continue to bring pressure to bear on the elite, the political class in , to hold them accountable for the distress facing the an people, but to hold them accountable for ensuring their well-being.We're going to continue to work together. We fully understand how important this task is.",
    "Yes Well, first and foremost, let's understand what's happening in Syria and how we got here What started off as peaceful protests against Asad, the President, evolved into a civil war because Asad met those protests with unimaginable brutality And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictatorPoint number two is that the reason Asad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past They're just more overt about it They have been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because they've seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his countrySo in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive\u2014that keeps the State intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive\u2014and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr Asad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians This is not a judgment I'm making, it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians makeAnd I said to Mr Putin that I'd be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr Asad and Iran, a political transition\u2014we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution\u2014but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Asad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire And it won't work And they will be there for a while if they don't take a different courseI also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL But what was very clear\u2014and regardless of what Mr Putin said\u2014was that he doesn't distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr Asad go From their perspective, they're all terrorists And that's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I rejectSo where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about deconfliction so that we're not seeing US and American [Russian; White House correction] firefights in the air But beyond that, we're very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Asad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people and that it has to stop And in order for it to stop, we're prepared to work with all the parties concerned But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr Asad's behaviorKeep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if we're ever going to have to have a political transition, we need And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are debilitated\u2014de-capacitated, and it's only strengthening ISIL And that's not good for anybodyIn terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldn't impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria, because eventually Syria will fall, the Asad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who we're working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country And so we will continue to support themThe training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country And I'm the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response we'd get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day we're having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime? And so it's been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when they've got bombs coming at them from the westSo what we're doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success\u2014for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out\u2014seeing if we can build on that But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that rightly believes, in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problemsNow, last point I just want to make about this, because sometimes, the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally: Mr Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength, but out of weakness, because his client, Mr Asad, was crumbling And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now he's got to put in his own planes and his own pilots And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there, I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly, the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind himIran and Asad make up Mr Putin's coalition at the moment The rest of the world makes up ours So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy It does not mean that we could not see Mr Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interests to broker a political settlement And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition, to come up with that political transition And nobody pretends that it's going to be easy, but I think it is still possible And so we will maintain lines of communicationBut we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that there's got to be a change in government We're not going to go back to the status quo ante And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive It's going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all\u2014that we all should be looking for",
    "Well, I think that I never have a green light. I'm bound by the Constitution; I'm bound by separation of powers. There are some things we can't do.Congress has the power of the purse, for example. I would love to fund a large infrastructure proposal right now that would put millions of people to work and boost our GDP. We know we've got roads and bridges and airports and electrical grids that need to be rebuilt. But without the cooperation of Congress, what I can do is speed up the permitting process, for example. I can make sure that we're working with the private sector to see if we can channel investment into much-needed projects. But ultimately, Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I don't have a green light.What I am consistently going to do is, wherever I have the legal authorities to make progress on behalf of middle class Americans and folks working to get into the middle class, whether it's by making sure that Federal contractors are paying a fair wage to their workers, making sure that women have the opportunity to make sure that they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job, where I have the capacity to expand some of the student loan programs that we've already put in place so that repayments are a little more affordable for college graduates\u2014I'm going to take\u2014I'm going to seize those opportunities. And that's what I think the American people expect me to do.My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but it's going to be longer lasting. And when you look at, for example, congressional inaction, and in particular, the inaction on the part of House Republicans, when it comes to immigration reform, now, here's an area where, as I've said before, not only the American people want to see action, not only is there 80 percent overlap between what Republicans say they want and Democrats say they want, we actually passed a bill out of the Senate that was bipartisan.And in those circumstances, what the American people expect is that, despite the differences between the parties, there should at least be the capacity to move forward on things we agree on. And that's not what we're seeing right now. So in the face of that kind of dysfunction, what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress.And we're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you, the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done. Even as we take these executive actions, I'm going to continue to reach out to Democrats and Republicans\u2014to the Speaker, to the leadership on both sides and in both Chambers\u2014to try to come up with formulas where we can make progress, even if it's incremental.",
    "I would like to involve Congress, yes. And no, I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau. I really did. Other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an airplane and I wasn't watching. He learned. That's going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada. He learned. You can't do that. You can't do that.We left. We had a very good relationship. I've had a good relationship with Justin. I have a good relationship with all. I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel. But on NATO, we're paying 4.2 percent; she's paying 1 percent of a much smaller GDP than we have. We're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger\u2014we're paying for\u2014I mean, anyone can say\u2014from 60 to 90 percent of NATO. And we're protecting countries of Europe. And then, on top of it, they kill us on trade. So you\u2014we just can't have it that way. It's unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.But no, I have a good relationship with Justin. And I have a, I think, a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now. I really do. I think\u2014I hope it's good because if it is, we're going to solve a very big problem.

    "Well, it's going to be real easy. They either\u2014for example, on cybersecurity, are we going to work out where they take action against ransomware criminals on n territory? They didn't do it. I don't think they planned it, in this case. And they\u2014are they going to act? We'll find out.Will we commit\u2014what can we commit to act in terms of anything affecting violating international norms that negatively affects ? What are we going to agree to do? And so I think we have real opportunities to move.And I think that one of the things that I noticed when we had the larger meeting is that people who are very, very well-informed started thinking, You know, this could be a real problem. What happens if that ransomware outfit were sitting in Florida or Maine and took action, as I said, on their single lifeline to their economy: oil? That would be devastating. And they're, like\u2014you could see them kind of go\u2014not that we would do that\u2014but like, Whoa.So it's in\u2014it's in everybody's interest that these things be acted on.

    "Here's what I learned, here's what I learned. I learned that it's important to establish a personal relations with leaders even though you may not agree with them\u2014certain leaders. I'm not going to have a personal relationship with Kim Jong Il, and our relationships are such that that's impossible.But U.S.-Russian relations are important. It's important for stability. It's important for our relations in Europe. And therefore, my advice is to establish a personal relationship with whoever is in charge of foreign policy in Russia. It's in our country's interest to do so.Now, it makes it easier, by the way, when there's a trustworthy relationship to be able to disagree and yet maintain common interests in other areas. And so we've had our disagreements. As you know, Putin is a straightforward, pretty tough character when it comes to his interests. Well, so am I. And we've had some headbutts, diplomatic headbutts. You might remember the trip to Slovakia. I think you were there at the famous press conference. But\u2014and yet, in spite of that, our differences of opinion, we still have got a cordial enough relationship to be able to deal with common threats and opportunities. And that's going to be important for the next President to maintain.Yes, Jonathan [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].",
    "No, thanks. A couple of points on that. First of all, I don't think I called for a deadline. I thought I said, time; I did? What exactly did I say? I said, deadline? Okay, yes, then I meant what I said. [] The question is whether or not there is going to be endless dialog on a subject that we have made up our mind about. We believe Kosovo ought to be independent.The G-8 discussions were all aimed at determining whether or not there is a way to make this acceptable to Russia. The ideal would be for Russia to say: Okay, we understand, and we accept this conclusion as well. And obviously, they're not there yet. And therefore, the reason why I said there needs to be movement is that there just cannot be continued drift, because I'm worried about expectations not being met in Kosovo. That's what I meant. And therefore, we'll push the process. President Putin made an interesting proposal on missile defense for Europe. I suggested\u2014and I've made an interesting proposal for missile defense in Europe, by the way, all aimed at protecting Europe, not aimed at Russia. The reason I did is because the true threats we'll be facing will be from rogue nations that may end up with a deliverable weapon. So, I thought it was in the interest of peace that we have the capacity to intercept such a missile, and, therefore, need to proceed.And President Putin said, Well, I think I've got an idea that makes sense. And this is the joint use of radar in Azerbaijan. I said, Well, why don't we look at it? But during the discussions, it became apparent that he also had doubts about the proposal I made, as to its effectiveness or necessity. And I said: Well, you put out an idea, and I put an idea. Why don't we both get a group together to discuss our relative ideas in a transparent fashion; so put\u2014get people from your Foreign Ministry, and we'll get people from the State Department and our respective defense departments and militaries to sit at the table and to share different ideas, to share ideas about technologies on how to intercept a missile and radar positioning to make sure that there's effective coverage?I thought his statement was an important statement to make. In other words, he recognized that there's an opportunity to work together. That's what friends do, by the way. Russia is not our enemy. As I said repeatedly, the cold war is over, and now we're dealing with threats in the 21st century. And I appreciated his recognition that there could be an opportunity to work together to deal with those threats. I viewed it as a very positive gesture, and looking forward to continuing discussions on this very subject in July when he comes to Maine. I would like to add for the citizens of Kosovo and its leadership, in my discussions, I found out consciousness and awareness of President Bush for the consequences of prolongation on\u2014 unacceptable prolongation around justifiable\u2014prolongation of the process. And in this context, they should be clear that the President is aware of these consequences and is not willing them to be.",
    "Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last 8 years. And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding.So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately, it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German and I had a vote, I might support her. [] But it's\u2014I don't know whether that hurts or helps. []With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region, and it has influence around the world. And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation.I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing and they are having good relationships with their neighbors and participating constructively on big issues like climate change.So I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world.The values that we talked about\u2014the values of democracy and free speech and international norms and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2014those things are not something that we can set aside. And so in\u2014on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we've had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.And I don't expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria\u2014that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we'll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together.I am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security, I think, is very important.And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks. This isn't new. It's not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, although we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we're monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening.I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don't see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn't become a lawless, low-level battlefield.And we've started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G-20, the G-7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front. Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I'm very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it is\u2014it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it's about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest.So we will continue this. I will continue this with\u2014I approach this with an open mind, and I'll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump.Secondly, on Russia, I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I'm saying this from a European vantage point, from a European\u2014from a German vantage point, sorry. The fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts.But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective\u2014from the European perspective\u2014I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. And just look at Poland\u2014the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn't keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements.And this is what I'm going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.",

    "What I certainly recognize with respect to immigration reform\u2014and I've said this in the past\u2014is that we have a broken system. It's underresourced, and we've got to make choices in terms of how we allocate personnel and resources.So if I'm going to, for example, send more immigration judges down to the border to process some of these unaccompanied children that have arrived at the border, then that's coming from someplace else, and we're going to have to prioritize. That's well within our authorities and prosecutorial discretion.My preference would be an actual comprehensive immigration law. And we already have a bipartisan law that would solve a whole bunch of these problems. Until that happens, I'm going to have to make choices.

    "As I said before, I don't want to try to read the tea leaves on election results. What I am going to try to do as President is to make sure that I'm advancing what I think is best for the country. And here's an opportunity where I can use my administrative authorities, executive authorities, and lawfully try to make improvements on the existing system, understanding that that's not going to fix the entire problem and we're much better off if we go ahead and pass a comprehensive bill. And I hope that the Republicans really want to get it passed. If they do, they're going to have a lot of cooperation from me.So let me just tick off: On Keystone, there's an independent process. It's moving forward. And the\u2014I'm going to let that process play out. I've given some parameters in terms of how I think about it: Ultimately, is this going to be good for the American people? Is it going to be good for their pocketbook? Is it going to actually create jobs? Is it actually going to reduce gas prices that have been coming down? And is it going to be, on net, something that doesn't increase climate change that we're going to have to grapple with?There's a pending case before a Nebraska judge about some of the siting. The process is moving forward, and I'm just going to gather up the facts.I will note, while this debate about Canadian oil has been raging\u2014keep in mind this is Canadian oil, this isn't U.S. oil\u2014while that debate has been raging, we've seen the\u2014some of the biggest increases in American oil production and American natural gas production in our history. We are closer to energy independence than we've ever been before or at least as we've been in decades. We are importing less foreign oil than we produce for the first time in a very long time. We've got a hundred-year supply of natural gas that, if we responsibly tap, puts us in the strongest position when it comes to energy of any industrialized country around the world. If you\u2014when I travel to Asia or I travel to Europe, their biggest envy is the incredible homegrown U.S. energy production that is producing jobs and attracting manufacturing, because locating here means you've got lower energy costs.So our energy sector is booming. And I'm happy to engage Republicans with additional ideas for how we can enhance that. I should note that our clean energy production is booming as well. And so Keystone I just consider as one small aspect of a broader trend that's really positive for the American people.And let's see\u2014see, the\u2014Okay, medical device tax. I've already answered the question. We are going to take a look at whatever ideas\u2014let me take a look comprehensively at the ideas that they present. Let's give them time to tell me.

    "[] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities.

It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are\u2014with Russia.We're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[]\u2014with him about our concerns.

    "Well, go ahead, David. Well, first of all, on the documents, the proper process here is that the Cabinet Secretary should look back over this decision and the circumstances surrounding it, should identify those documents that should be published. It should be right that Ministers in the previous Government should be consulted about the publication of those documents. And of course we will consult with them over that.But in my view, there is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation of the circumstances surrounding this decision. I think the key thing, though, to remember is that in the end, it was a decision by the Scottish Executive.On the issue of an inquiry, as I said, I'm not currently minded to hold an inquiry because I think publishing this information, combined with the inquiry that has already been, will give people the certainty that they need about the circumstances surrounding this decision. But the key thing is to get the information out there so people can see. But I don't think there's any great mystery here. There was a decision taken by the Scottish Executive, in my view, a wholly wrong and misguided decision, a bad decision, but the decision nonetheless. That's what happened. And I don't think we need an extra inquiry to tell us that that's what happened. But the information, as I said, will be gone over and published, as appropriate. And of course I'll be consulting with previous Ministers and Prime Ministers, as you should do in the normal way. I think the simple answer is, we should have all the facts; they should be laid out there. And I have confidence that Prime Minister Cameron's government will be cooperative in making sure that the facts are there. That will not negate the fact that, as the Prime Minister indicated, it was a very poor decision and one that not only ran contrary to, I think, how we should be treating terrorists, but also didn't reflect the incredible pain that the families who were affected still suffer to this day. And my administration is in regular contact with these families, and this was a heartbreaking decision for them that reopened a whole host of new wounds.So my expectation is, is that the facts will be out there, and, as David indicated, with all the facts out, I think we're going to be back to where we are right now, which it was--it's--it was a decision that should not have been made and one that we should learn from going forward.Laura Meckler [Wall Street Journal].",
    "Well, I don't have a crystal ball, Ben, but I will say this. First of all, we've grown the economy by a million jobs over the last year. So that's pretty noticeable. I think those million people who've been hired notice those paychecks. And that's 10 consecutive months of private sector job growth.In order to speed up job growth, we've put forward a range of proposals that I hope to discuss with Democratic and Republican leaders, because I don't think we can just stand pat. I continue to believe that we need to invest in a creaky infrastructure back home. And I think as you travel around Asia, you start seeing other countries investing in infrastructure. That's what the United States has done in the past, but we've been living off the investments that we made back in the thirties, forties, fifties, and sixties. And it's time for us to make sure that we've upgraded our roads and our railways and our airports. That will make us more productive and will put people back to work right now.I continue to believe that it is important for us to work with businesses to see if we can incentivize them to invest now rather than holding cash waiting for the future. They've got cash to spend. And so we've put forward a series of tax proposals that historically Republicans have supported. And my expectation would be, there's no reason for them not to support it just because I'm supporting it. And so that's a conversation that I hope to have next week.But we have a recovery. It needs to be speeded up. Government can't hire back the 8 million people who lost their jobs. Ultimately, that's up to the private sector. But I think we can set the conditions whereby we're seeing significant improvement during the course of the next year, the next 2 years, and we can chip away at the unemployment rate so that we get back to the kinds of levels that reflect a growing middle class and increased opportunity for all people.Jake Tapper [ABC News].",

    "[Inaudible]\u2014the P-5plus-1. And I told Silvio I'd seriously consider it. I also made it clear, however, that all of us, P-5-plus-1 or not, need to be sending the same message to the Iranians, which is, verifiably suspend your enrichment program or else you will face further sanctions and further isolation. And the sad thing about this issue is that the Iranian people are suffering. They could be doing a lot better. Their lives could be much more hopeful, except their Government has made the decision to defy the demands of the free world, has made the decision to ignore the IAEA, and has continued to enrich in a way that we think is dangerous.And so the choice is theirs to make. Foreign Minister Solana is going to see the Iranianhere very shortly, and his message is one that\u2014is the one I just delivered. And it's\u2014I hope for the sake of the Iranian people that their Government changes course. There is a better way forward.I want to remind you something about this Iranian issue. Vladimir Putin, our mutual friend, went to the Iranians and said, you have a right to have civilian nuclear power. I have said the same thing publicly as well. I mean, I'm a big believer in nuclear power. I think the best way to deal with climate change is the spread of nuclear power. The best way to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy is nuclear power. And I believe Iran should have a civilian nuclear power. I don't believe they can be entrusted to enrich.And therefore, Vladimir Putin went and said\u2014and he believes that\u2014and he said, we'll provide the fuel for you, and we'll not only provide the fuel, we'll gather the spent fuel, so you don't need to enrich. So the argument of the Iranian Government that we have a right to have civilian nuclear power has been undermined by the Russian proposal.And so it will be interesting to see their decision. But what they need to hear is, is that we are firm in our resolve to prevent them from having the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. And with regard to the question addressed to me, we've offered to join the other European countries, plus China, plus Russia, in order to make our contribution to the negotiations which are underway with the Iranian Government. Now, our offer is based on the fact that we know Iran very well from the inside. We have some leading companies that are operating in these countries, and therefore, we think that this would be very useful in helping President Bush and Vladimir Putin to pursue the strategy that they've determined for that country.Now, we obviously need to make sure that nuclear energy is being used for only peaceful reasons. With regard to the sanctions proposed by the United Nations, we have always abided by those. And the presence of our businesses have to do with agreements and contracts which date back several years.Now, with regard to our willingness to remove or lift any caveats with regard to Afghanistan, we discussed that. And we also said that we are willing to keep our troops in other fronts, as it were, in other areas\u2014 in Kosovo and Lebanon and wherever it is that our Italian soldiers are today.And I thank President Bush for his appreciation and acknowledgment of the Italian commitment in these international fronts. And in fact, there are 40,000 troops that are currently operating in our foreign missions. And we\u2014there\u2014we obviously have a turnover, and we always manage to keep that very large number of troops there. And we will continue, therefore, to pursue this, because we are fully convinced that it is extremely important to be able to establish democracy in Iraq. This is a very important country in that region, and we'll obviously continue to pursue our other efforts. And we obviously back any agreement that will help us to overcome any divisions in Lebanon.And we're also working on the agreements\u2014on the negotiations for an agreement in Israel and the Middle East. And we are hoping that in all these countries it will be possible to establish peace and that they will certainly be able to become fully established democracies.The second Italian journalist is from ANSA, the leading news agency.",
    "Interesting way to put it. First of all, I think they're patriotic people who care about our country\u2014back to Hutch's penetrating comment\u2014or question. I do. I was very appreciative of the reception I got at the State of the Union. It was a cordial, respectful reception that gave me a chance to talk about what I believe. I was also very grateful for the reception I received at the Democratic retreat that I went to there in Virginia.You know, my impression of the meeting there was that we share a lot in common. We're people that actually put filing papers down and ran for office; we're willing to put our families through the grind of politics; we wanted to serve our country, that we care deeply about what takes place in Washington, America, and the world.My hope is, is that we can get positive pieces of legislation passed, because I think there's a lot of expectation that the difference of opinion on Iraq would make it impossible for us to work on other areas. I disagree with that assessment. And I hope I'm right, and the best way to determine whether I'm right is, will I be able to sign legislation that we have been able to work on?One such piece of policy is a balanced budget. There seems to be agreement that we should have a balanced budget. I laid out one way forward to achieve that balance, and it shows that we can balance the budget without raising taxes and do so in a 5-year horizon. And I would like to work with the Democrat leadership as well as obviously my Republican folks, to get it done.Secondly, an interesting opportunity is immigration. As you know, I strongly believe that we need to enforce our borders and that\u2014and have taken steps to do so. But I also believe that in order to enforce the borders, we need a temporary-worker program so that people don't try to sneak in the country to work, that they can come in an orderly fashion, and take the pressure off the Border Patrol agents that we've got out there, so that the Border Patrol agents don't focus on workers that are doing jobs Americans aren't doing but are focusing on terrorists and criminal elements, gun runners, to keep the country\u2014both our countries safe\u2014Mexico and the United States safe.I also know that we need to deal with the people who are here\u2014the 12 million people who are here illegally. I have said multiple times that we can't kick them out of our country. It doesn't make any sense to me to try to do that, and I don't think\u2014 maybe some feel that way, but I don't feel that way. But I also don't believe we should give them automatic amnesty\u2014automatic citizenship, which I view as amnesty. And we look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans to have a comprehensive immigration plan.Energy is an opportunity for us to work together. We've done a lot of work in the past on promoting alternative sources of energy. America has done more than any nation in the world in promoting alternatives and renewables, all aiming to make sure our economy grows, that we have energy independence, and that we're good stewards of the environment. And I look forward to working with the Democrats on the energy independence initiative I laid out.One such initiative was the mandatory fuel standards that relies upon alternative fuel to power automobiles. Ethanol is the first and most notable place where we can start, but we also need to spend monies to develop technologies that will enable us to make energy out of products other than corn, switchgrass or wood chips, for example.The problem with relying only on corn is that\u2014by the way, when your demand for corn stays high, the price tends to go up, and your hog farmer gets disgruntled with the alternative energy plan. And therefore, what's going to matter is that new technologies come on line as quickly as possible to take the pressure off of corn ethanol\u2014or corn, as a result of being used in ethanol, and we can work with Congress to do that. That's an area we can work.Health care: I got a letter the other day from a group of Republican and Democrat Senators talking about the desire to work on health care. And they liked some of my ideas. But my only point is, is that there's an opportunity for us to work together to help the uninsured have private insurance so they can be\u2014so they can get good health care. And there's an opportunity to work together there.The Governors are coming into town soon. And I'm going to have Secretary Leavitt describe to them the affordable grants program that is a part of our comprehensive approach, including rewriting the Tax Code.Finally, No Child Left Behind needs to be reauthorized. I fully understand that if you read your newspaper articles\u2014which I do, sometimes\u2014and listen carefully, you'll hear voices in both parties saying they don't like No Child Left Behind\u2014it's too much testing, or we don't want to be held to account, or whatever they say. The bill is working. It makes a lot of sense.There's an income gap in America that I talked about when I went to Wall Street. And what's clear to me is that our kids have got to have education so that in this global economy, the jobs of the 21st century stay here at home. And it starts with good education. And therefore, I will argue vociferously that No Child Left Behind Act needs to be reauthorized\u2014it's working; it's an important piece of legislation\u2014and will reach out to Democrat Members, as well as Republican Members, to get this bill reauthorized.And so there's a lot of areas, Mike. I'd say it's a little early in the process. This is a 2-year term. We've got time to work together to get important pieces of legislation done. And I like the start. As a matter of fact, this afternoon I've got members of both parties, both Chambers coming down to visit about how we can continue to work together to get some legislation done.As I told the Democrats, and as the Democrats have made clear to me in my visits, that neither of us are going to abandon our principles, that I don't expect them to change their principles, and they shouldn't expect me to. But there's ways for us to work together to achieve legislative successes for the common good. That's what the American people want to see, and that's what I believe we can do. Is it going to take work? Yes, it's going to take work, but it's okay. That's why you pay us all this money.Richard [Richard Wolffe, Newsweek].",
    "Well they are a very important part of it but they don't really have to be. We're just getting started.We have\u2014and as you know we have a very good\u2014David Friedman a great gentleman. One of the most successful lawyers in New York who loves Israel\u2014David Friedman. Jason Greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer. Great talent. Jared Kushner. And with me being President if you don't get that deal done it will never happen. We'll have to see what happens.But I think the Palestinians basically\u2014I'm not sure\u2014I know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that's okay. I fully understand where they're coming from.As you know I've ended the money to\u2014that was\u2014we were paying them $550 million a year and I ended that money because a year ago I heard they were saying nasty things. I said: Wait a minute. We're trying to make a deal. We're trying to help them and they're saying these nasty things? We're not going to pay.Now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis. Not so different from the border. Because you see the problems and what's going on. It's terrible. But I think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that's probably the toughest deal of all. And it may very well be the toughest deal of all. A lot of people think it can't be made. I mean over the years a lot of people would say That's a deal that can't be made no matter what.But you know hey I like to\u2014we're going to try. But I really believe that\u2014I went to other negotiators from past years. For many many years they've been trying to make this deal. And I said Did you ever take the money away? Because they were always very hostile. And they said: No we wouldn't do that. That's inappropriate. Why is it inappropriate? I mean they're saying bad things. Why is it inappropriate?And what I've done is said Look as long\u2014if you're not negotiating and if you don't want to make peace we're not going to pay you. So let's see what happens.I think they want to make a deal and I've had a very good relationship with some of their leaders. And obviously I've had a good relationship with Israel.Now the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with Bibi Netanyahu's election. They thought he won and then all of a sudden they couldn't put together the coalition. And now they're back to campaigning again. So that was something that came up that\u2014who would have expected that. Maybe something will happen faster but you know that's going to be going on for about 3 months.There's a good chance we could\u2014there's a chance. I don't want to even say good chance on that one because people say it's the hardest deal. I've heard\u2014when I was young I'd say What do you think of this? They'd say Oh that's tougher than Israel and the Palestinians making a deal. They used to use that as like the metaphor. They used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make. So it's probably about the toughest deal to make.I actually think that there's a good chance.Yes sir. Please go ahead. Yes. White shirt. No the gentleman behind you. Yes. Okay go ahead.",

    "Yes, no, I don't take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we're talking about. And what we've done is redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behind me. And we're now in very, very strong shape.I think we'll be announcing, as I said, Sunday night, and this will start very quickly. And we'll have the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time. So no.And what we have done\u2014and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future, in case something like this happens again.

    "I have had no comment on\u2014no comment now on Scott's book.Secondly, I would ask him to listen carefully to Ryan Crocker and General Petraeus. It's\u2014there's a temptation to kind of get\u2014let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders. That's why I strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal. It's kind of like an arbitrary thing, you know\u2014 We will decide in the Halls of Congress how to conduct our affairs in based upon polls and politics, and we're going to impose this on people\u2014as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats, and listening to the is, for that matter. The is have invited us to be there. But they share a goal with us, which is to get our combat troops out, as conditions permit. Matter of fact, that's what we're doing. Return on success has been the strategy of this administration, and our troops are coming home, but based upon success.And so I would ask whoever goes there\u2014whatever elected official goes there, to listen carefully to what is taking place and understand that the best way to go forward is to listen to the parties who are actually on the ground. And that's hard to do. I understand for some in Washington there's a lot of pressure. You got these groups out there\u2014MoveOn.org, you know\u2014banging away on these candidates, and it's hard to kind of divorce yourself from the politics.And so I'm glad all the\u2014a lot of these elected officials are going over there, because they'll get an interesting insight, something that you don't get from just reading your wonderful newspapers or listening to your TV shows.John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].",
    "Yes. I say the Democrats are sabotaging the Post Office because they're not approving $25 billion that was requested.

Therefore all of this\u2014and all of the tremendous mistakes that were made with regard to mail-in voting\u2014all of these tremendous mistakes you can't even\u2014you can't even do it. I would imagine the courts\u2014you know this is in many courts right now. They're showing all of the disasters that have taken place just in the last short period of time\u2014in the last 2 months\u2014with respect to universal mail-in voting.

    "Well, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree, because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who, I think, likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.And what's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately, he's pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the Federal Government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first 2 years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he's really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I'll use a obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.So, obviously, this has been the holy grail for Republicans over the last 6, 7 yearswas, We've got to kill Obamacare. Now, that has been taken as an article of faith, that this is terrible, it doesn't work, and we have to undo it.But now that Republicans are in charge, they've got to take a look and say, let's see, we've got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the Federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefiting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of, everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.Now, it's one thing to characterize thesethis thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge, and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off, and suddenly, they don't have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business, that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parent's health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first ones to say, that's great, congratulations.If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger; a Federal Government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him.",
    "Well, that's an argument that I've made personally. The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them. And the specific question presented before the Court right now is whether Prop. 8 and the California law is unconstitutional.And what we've done is we've put forward a basic principle, which is\u2014which applies to all equal protection cases. Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court asks the question, what's the rationale for this\u2014and it better be a good reason. And if you don't have a good reason, we're going to strike it down.And what we've said is, is that same-sex couples are a group, a class, that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the Supreme Court needs to ask the State why it's doing it. And if the State doesn't have a good reason, it should be struck down. That's the core principle, as applied to this case.Now, what the Court\u2014the Court may decide that if it doesn't apply in this case, it probably can't apply in any case. There's no good reason for it. If I were on the Court, that would probably be the view that I'd put forward. But I'm not a judge, I'm the President. So the basic principle, though, is let's treat everybody fairly; let's treat everybody equally.

    "I certainly hope it changes tomorrow. But it's\u2014I'm also realistic to know things don't change on a dime. But nevertheless, the economy is growing. There's obviously financial uncertainty. We've talked about the decisions on the GSEs here. People need to know that if they've got a deposit in a commercial bank, the Government will make good up to $100,000 worth of their deposit. There's no question, it's a time of uncertainty. There's a lot of events taking place at the same time. But we can pass some good law to help expedite the recovery.One such law is a good housing\u2014piece of housing legislation. The Congress needs to get moving on it. Another such law is to send a signal that we're willing to explore for oil here at home. I fully understand that this is a transition period away from hydrocarbons, but we ought to be wise about how we use our own resources. I think it would be a powerful signal if we announce that we're going to really get after it when it comes to oil shale. There's enormous reserves in the western States. And I think if the world saw that we're willing to put a focused, concerted effort on using new technologies to bring those reserves to bear, which would then relieve some pressure on gasoline prices, it would have an impact.The other thing is, is that\u2014I'm sure you know this, April, but we haven't built a refinery\u2014a new refinery in the United States since the early seventies. It makes no sense. And yet you try to get one permitted, it is unbelievably difficult to do. People aren't willing to risk capital if they're deeply concerned about how their capital is going to be tied up in lawsuits or regulations. And we import a lot of gasoline, refined product, from overseas.So there's some things we can do to send signals that it's important that we can get the economy\u2014take advantage of the positive aspects and get it moving stronger again.The other thing is trade. It is\u2014I don't understand the decision on the Colombia free trade market\u2014free trade agreement. The Congress has given preferential treatment to goods coming out of Colombia through the Andean Trade Preference Act. In other words, Colombia businesses can sell into our country relatively duty free. And yet we don't have the same\u2014we don't get the same treatment. Now, why does that make sense? It doesn't.You know, trade\u2014our trade or exports have helped keep the economy growing, April, as paltry as it may be. Doesn't it make sense for us to continue to open up further opportunities to sell goods? I think it does. I do not understand why it's okay for Colombia to be able to sell into our country close to duty free, and we don't have the same advantage. And secondly, turning our back on somebody like Uribe makes no sense at all. He is a courageous fighter against terrorists. And yet our Congress won't even bring up a free trade agreement with Colombia.Anyway, it's\u2014politics is just choking good sense. And the other thing is, is that once we get moving on Colombia, we need to get moving on Panama and South Korea. It's in our country's interest we do that.Olivier.

This is a na-tion\u2014 is a nation that is testing ballistic missiles. And it is a nation that is trying to enrich uranium. The NIE says this is a country that had a covert nuclear weapons program, which, by the way, they have failed to disclose, even today. They have never admitted the program existed in the first place.The danger is, is that they can enrich, play like they got a civilian program\u2014or have a civilian program, or claim it's a civilian program\u2014and pass the knowledge to a covert military program. And then the danger is, is at some point in the future, they show up with a weapon. And my comments are, now is the time to work together to prevent that scenario from taking place. It's in our interests.Yes, ma'am.",

    "No, I haven't at all. I've been meeting\u2014when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues?

    "Well, first of all, I think it's important, Leo, to remember the timeline for a withdrawal down to a Embassy-centered presence, a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016. So that hasn't changed. Our transition out of a combat role has not changed.Now, I am the first to say that as long as our men and women in uniform are serving in Afghanistan, there are risks involved. It's a dangerous place. Casualties have come down precipitously as we've engaged in the drawdown. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed in Afghanistan. That has occurred precisely because we're not in a combat role. And I think it is worth noting the significant casualties that the Afghan security services have incurred. As we've drawn down, they've stood up, and they're fighting. And they're fighting with courage and tenacity, and they're getting better month by month. But you can't minimize the sacrifices that our military families make. It means some folks are going to be rotating back into Afghanistan for a few extra months relative to what otherwise would have been the case. We're essentially moving the drawdown pace over to the right for several months, in part to compensate for the lengthy period it took for Government formation; in part because we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to help Afghan security forces succeed so we don't have to go back, so we don't have to respond in an emergency because counterterrorist\u2014or because terrorist activities are being launched out of Afghanistan.We're on the path to do that, and it was my assessment as Commander in Chief that it made sense for us to provide a few extra months for us to be able to help on things like logistics, making sure that equipment is not just in place, but it's also used properly; that the training and advising and strategic input that's been provided continues through this fighting season, in part so that President Karzai [Ghani]*, who has taken on the mantle of Commander in Chief in a way that we have not seen in the past from an Afghan President, can do a serious review and can assess here is where our strengths are, here's where our weaknesses are, and we can proceed with more effective joint planning going forward.So the bottom line is our men and women in uniform make enormous sacrifices. Their families do too; they serve alongside them. This will mean that there are going to be some of our folks who are in Afghanistan under the new schedule who would have been home. But it is important to keep in perspective, first of all, that we've gone down from 100,000 down to under 10,000; that they are not on the front lines because they're not in a combat role. We are doing all that we can do to make sure that force protection is a priority for those who are in Afghanistan. And the date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change.But it is my judgment, it's the judgment of General Campbell and others who are on the ground, that providing this additional timeframe during this fighting season for us to be able to help the Afghan security forces succeed is well worth it. And in that sense, once again, we are asking our men and women in uniform to fight on behalf of our freedom and on behalf of a more orderly world.It does, perhaps, raise one thought, which is, right now there's a debate going up on Capitol Hill about budgets. This would be a good time for my friends up on Capitol Hill, including on the other side of the aisle, to take a look at their budgets. If we're holding both our defense and nondefense budgets to 2006 levels, it's a lot harder for us to do the job that we need to do not only on the national security side, but also here at home, making sure that when our men and women come home, and when they potentially go into civilian life, that they've got a strong economy, that their kids have good schools, that they can send their kids to college, that they get the veterans benefits that they have so richly earned and deserve. That would be a good way for us to express the thanks for the sacrifices they consistently make. I met yesterday the widow of General Greene. She would like the memory of her husband to be preserved by a sustainable Afghanistan that is secure. The 2,215 Americans that have died must not die in vain. They must leave behind a legacy of a stable Afghanistan. And it's that preservation of those gains that I think inspires the American service men and women to obey the call of their commander, the order of their commanders.Second, we have taken them out of the harm's way. As the President mentioned, for the past 100 days, because the combat role has ended, the exposure, the number of casualties is really down. There isn't\u2014my most horrible reading of the day is my first, middle-of-the-day, and end-of-the-day security reports where I see the casualties of the Afghan figures. But thank God they're no longer American or European casualties.John Campbell is making sure that they remain in support role. Their train, advise, assist role has risks, but they're nowhere comparable to combat role. And end of that combat role is very significant to this. And again, the institutional gains that would be achieved through the train, advise, and assist role is what will guarantee that the investments of the last 14 years pay off in terms of gains that would ensure.Last point: Afghanistan is the front line. Because of American engagement in Afghanistan, there have not been attacks on mainland United States. But let's not forget that fortresses cannot be built around countries or continents. We are living in an interconnected world, and our security is joined together./U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/Afghan Security Forces",

    "Well, maybe I'll go first, because I didn't criticize the I have a lot of respect for the And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the And I said tremendous things. And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it. But we record when we deal with reporters. It's called fake news. You know, we solve a lot of problems with the good, old recording instrument.But what happens is that\u2014look, the Prime Minister, as I really just said, she's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us. We're, by far, their biggest trading partner. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to double, triple, quadruple that.So if they're going a slightly different route\u2014and I know they do want independence. It's going to be independence; it's just your definition. But if they're going to go a certain route, I just said that I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States. I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.So, based on that, I\u2014and based on just trade in general, and our other relationship\u2014which will be fine\u2014but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade, and they want to be able to trade, and I think we'll be able to do that. Okay? And I think she's doing a terrific job, by the way.. Thank you, Mr. President. And just to confirm what the President just said, Laura, there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union, on the basis of the agreement that was made here at Chequers and that I've put forward to the European Union. And just to be clear, that is an agreement that delivers on the Brexit vote that we had in 2016 here in the U.K., that delivers what I believe is at the forefront of people's mind when they were voting to leave the European Union.So at the end of these negotiations, we will ensure that free movement will come to an end. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice here in the U.K. will come to an end. The sending of vast sums of money every year to the EU will come to an end. We will come out of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will come out of the Common Fisheries Policy. And we will ensure, by not being in the Customs Union, that we are able to have an independent trade policy and do those trade deals around the world. And as you've heard from the President, the United States is keen for us. We're keen to work with them. And we will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.Mr. President, would you like to select a person? Jonathan Swan, go ahead. /North Atlantic Treaty Organization",
    "You know, victory in Iraq is not going to be like victory in World War II. And it's one of the challenges I have, to explain to the American people what Iraq will look like in a situation that will enable us to say, we have accomplished our mission.First, the\u2014Iraq will be a society in which there is relative peace. I say relative peace because if it's, like, zero car bombings, it never will happen that way. It's like\u2014I mean, the fundamental question is, can we help this Government have the security force level necessary to make sure that the ethnic cleansing that was taking place in certain neighborhoods has stopped?Look, there's criminality in Iraq as well as the ethnic violence. And we've got to help the Iraqis have a police force that deals with criminals. There is an Al Qaida presence in Iraq, as you know. I believe some of the spectacular bombings have been caused by Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, Zarqawi\u2014the terrorist Zarqawi, who is not an Iraqi\u2014made it very clear that he intended to use violence to spur sectarian\u2014car bombings and spectacular violence\u2014to spur sectarian violence. And he did a good job of it.And so there\u2014and then there's this disaffected Sunnis, people who believe that they should still be in power in spite of the fact that the Shi'a are the majority of the country. And they're willing to use violence to try to create enough chaos so they get back in power.The reason I described that is that no matter what you call it, it's a complex situation, and it needed to be dealt with inside of Iraq. We've got people who say civil war; we've got people on the ground who don't believe it's a civil war. But nevertheless, it is\u2014it was dangerous enough that I had to make a decision to try to stop it, so that a government that is bound by a constitution, where the country feels relatively secure as a result of a security force that is evenhanded in its application of security; a place where the vast resources of the country\u2014this is a relatively wealthy country, in that they've got a lot of hydrocarbons\u2014is shared equally amongst people; that there is a federalism that evolves under the Constitution, where the local Provinces have got authority as well; and where people who may have made a political decision in the past and yet weren't criminals can participate in the life of the country; and is an ally in the war on terror\u2014in other words, that there is a bulwark for moderation as opposed to a safe haven for extremism. And that's what I would view as successful.",
    "Well, first of all, there's no reason why we should. Remember what I said during the campaign. I thought that it was important for us to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share. I said that we were going to have to make some tough cuts, some tough decisions on the spending side, but what I wouldn't do was hurt vulnerable families, only to pay for a tax cut for somebody like me. And what I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases.That's exactly what I've put forward. What I've said is, is that in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things, some things that some Democrats don't want to see, and probably, there are a few Republicans who don't want to see either. But the only way that we're going to be able to stabilize the economy, make sure we've got a platform for long-term economic growth, that we get our deficits under control and we make sure that middle class families are protected is if we come up with something that members of both parties in Congress can support.And that's the plan that I've put forward. I have gone at least halfway in meeting some of the Republicans' concerns, recognizing that even though we campaigned on these issues, even though the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest few as a means of reducing the deficit, I have also said that I'm willing to identify some spending cuts that make sense.And frankly, up until about a couple of days ago, if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner, I think, were in a position to say, we've gotten a fair deal. The fact that they haven't taken it yet is puzzling and, I think, a question that you're going to have to address to them.I remain optimistic, though, because if you look at what the Speaker has proposed, he's conceded that income tax rates should go up, except right now he only wants to have them go up for millionaires. If you're making 900,000, somehow he thinks that you can't afford to pay a little more in taxes. But the principle that rates are going to need to go up he's conceded.I've said I'm willing to make some cuts. What separates us is probably a few hundred billion dollars. The idea that we would put our economy at risk because you can't bridge that gap doesn't make a lot of sense.So I'm going to continue to talk to the Speaker and the other leaders up in Congress. But ultimately, they've got to do their job. Right now their job is to make sure that middle class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced, responsible package of deficit reduction.It is there for all to see. It is a deal that can get done. But it is not going to be\u2014it cannot be done if every side wants 100 percent. And part of what voters were looking for is some compromise up here. That's what folks want. They understand that they're not going to get 100 percent of what they want. And for some reason, that message has not yet taken up on Capitol Hill.And when you think about what we've gone through over the last couple of months\u2014a devastating hurricane and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory\u2014the country deserves folks to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good and not tangle themselves up in a whole bunch of ideological positions that don't make much sense.So I remain not only open to conversations, but I remain eager to get something done. I'd like to get it done before Christmas. There's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill and instead of just going ahead and getting stuff done. And we've been wasting a lot of time. It is the right thing to do. I'm prepared to get it done. But they're going to have to go ahead and make some adjustments.And I'll just give you one other example. The Speaker now is proposing what he calls plan B. So he says, well, this would raise taxes only on folks making a million dollars or more. What that means is an average of a $50,000 tax break for every millionaire out there, at the same time as we're not providing unemployment insurance for 2 million people who are still out there looking for work. It actually means a tax increase for millions of working families across the country at the same time as folks like me would be getting a tax break. That violates the core principles that were debated during the course of this election and that the American people determined was the wrong way to go.And so my hope is, is that the Speaker and his caucus, in conjunction with the other legislative leaders up there, can find a way to make sure that middle class families don't see their taxes go up on January 1; that we make sure that those things that middle class families count on like tax credits for college or making sure that they're getting some help when it comes to raising their kids through things like the child tax credit, that that gets done; and that we have a balanced package for deficit reduction, which is exactly what I've put forward.",
    "Nothing surprises me in politics.",
    "Look, I believe this is solvable. I think that fair-minded people can come to an agreement that does not cause the economy to go back into recession, that protects middle class families, that focuses on jobs and growth, and reduces our deficit. I'm confident it can be done.My budget, frankly, does it. I understand that\u2014I don't expect the Republicans simply to adopt my budget. That's not realistic. So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise. And as I said on election night, compromise is hard and not everybody gets 100 percent of what they want and not everybody is going to be perfectly happy.But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified. And the reason I won't do that is because I don't want to find ourselves in a position 6 months from now or a year from now where, lo and behold, the only way to close the deficit is to sock it to middle class families or to burden families that have disabled kids or have a parent in a nursing home, or suddenly, we've got to cut more out of our basic research budget that is the key to growing the economy in the long term.So that's my concern. I'm less concerned about red lines per se. What I'm concerned about is not finding ourselves in a situation where the wealthy aren't paying more or aren't paying as much as they should, middle class families one way or another are making up the difference. That's the kind of status quo that has been going on here too long, and that's exactly what I argued against during this campaign. And if there's one thing that I'm pretty confident about is the American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another 4 years.They want compromise. They want action. But they also want to make sure that middle class folks aren't bearing the entire burden and sacrifice when it comes to some of these big challenges. They expect that folks at the top are doing their fair share as well. And that's going to be my guiding principle during these negotiations, but more importantly, during the next 4 years of my administration.Nancy Cordes [CBS News].",

    "I never release my full movie list.But let's talk of the specifics of what we now know. The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack.

We will respond proportionally, and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce here today at a press conference.More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates. Right now it's sort of the Wild West. And part of the problem is, is you've got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you've got nonstate actors that can do enormous damage. That's part of what makes this issue of cybersecurity so urgent.Again, this is part of the reason why it's going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information sharing we need. Because if we don't put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant.And by the way, I hear you're moving to Europe.

But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.So there's room to work if he wants to do that. But I think, as usual, he's going to\u2014well, I probably shouldn't go any further. But I think it will hurt him badly./North Atlantic Treaty Organization",
    "A couple of points on that\u2014one, the Turks, the Americans, and the Iraqis, including the Iraqi Kurds, share a common enemy in the PKK. And secondly, it's in nobody's interests that there be safe haven for people who are\u2014have the willingness to kill innocent people.A second point I want to make to you, Matt [Matt Spetalnick, Reuters], is that there is a Special Forces presence in northern Iraq, in Kurdistan, now, apart from what you're referring to. In other words\u2014 so there is a presence, and there has been a presence for a while.Thirdly, I strongly agree with the sentiments of Secretary Gates, who said that the incursion must be limited and must be temporary in nature. In other words, it shouldn't be long lasting. But the Turks need to move, move quickly, achieve their objective, and get out.",
    "Well, first, with respect to these new initiatives, this rotational deployment is significant because what it allows us to do is to not only build capacity and cooperation between our two countries, but it also allows us to meet the demands of a lot of partners in the region that want to feel that they're getting the training, they're getting the exercises, and that we have the presence that's necessary to maintain the security architecture in the region.And so, as Julia mentioned, this is a region that's becoming increasingly important. The economy in this area is going to be the engine for world economic growth for some time to come. The lines of commerce and trade are constantly expanding. And it's appropriate then for us to make sure that not only our alliance, but the security architecture of the region is updated for the 21st century, and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.It also allows us to respond to a whole host of challenges, like humanitarian or disaster relief, that frankly, given how large the Asia-Pacific region is, it can sometimes be difficult to do, and this will allow us to be able to respond in a more timely fashion and also equip a lot of countries, smaller countries who may not have the same capacity, it allows us to equip them so that they can respond more quickly as well.And I guess the last part of your question, with respect to China, I've said repeatedly and I will say again today that we welcome a rising, peaceful China. What they've been able to achieve in terms of lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last two decades has been nothing short of remarkable. And that is good not just for China, but it's potentially good for the region. And I know Australia's economy obviously has benefited by the increased demand that you're seeing in China.The main message that I've said not only publicly, but also privately to the Chinese is that with their rise comes increased responsibilities. It's important for them to play by the rules of the road and in fact help underwrite the rules that have allowed so much remarkable economic progress to be made over the last several decades. And that's going to be true on a whole host of issues.So where China is playing by those rules, recognizing its new role, I think this is a win-win situation. There are going to be times where they're not, and we will send a clear message to them that we think that they need to be on track in terms of accepting the rules and responsibilities that come with being a world power.With respect to Afghanistan, the impact of any loss of life among our troops is heartbreaking. And obviously, as President of the United States, there's no greater responsibility and nothing more difficult than putting our troops in harm's way. I think Prime Minister Gillard feels the same way that I do, which is we would not be sending our young men and women into harm's way unless we thought it was absolutely necessary for the security of our country.What we have established is a transition process that allows Afghans to build up their capacity and take on a greater security role over the next 2 years. But it's important that we do it right. As some of you are aware, I just announced that all remaining troops in Iraq will be removed. It would have been tempting, given that I have been opposed to the Iraq war from the start, when I came into office, to say, we're going to get you all out right away. But what I recognized was that if we weren't thoughtful about how we proceed, then the enormous sacrifices that had been made by our men and women in the previous years might be for naught.And what I'd say to the Australian people at this point is, given the enormous investment that's been made and the signs that we can, in fact, leave behind a country that's not perfect, but one that is more stable, more secure, and does not provide safe haven for terrorists, it's appropriate for us to finish the job and do it right. If I could just add to that and say, every time I have met President Obama and we've talked about our alliance, we've talked about our work in Afghanistan, and in our meetings, both formal and informal, the President has shown the greatest possible concern for our troops in the field. Now, the meetings we've had over the last few weeks at various international events have coincided with some of the most bitter and difficult news that we've had from Afghanistan, and every step of the way the President has gone out of his way to convey to me his condolences for the Australian people and particularly for the families that have suffered such a grievous loss.

    "Well, I think that you will see at this summit a broad-based agreement from all countries, including Germany, that we need to ensure balanced and sustainable growth. And it is my expectation that the communique will begin to put in place mechanisms that help us track and encourage such balanced and sustainable growth.The most important thing that the United States can do for the world economy is to grow, because we continue to be the world's largest market and a huge engine for all other countries to grow. Countries like Germany that export heavily benefit from our open markets and us buying their goods. That's true for every G-20 member.And so the point that we have consistently made is that in a prudent, stable way, we want to make sure that we are boosting growth rates at home as well as abroad. It is difficult to do that if we start seeing the huge imbalances redevelop that helped to contribute to the crisis that we just went through. And I don't think this is a controversial proposition. In fact, we set up a framework back in Pittsburgh that discussed this, and this is just a follow-on to the work that we've already done.Now, as I've said, I think, when I was first asked this in India, it's not our habit to comment on actions by the Federal Reserve. But as President of the United States, I can tell you that my instructions to my team, including Secretary Geithner, is to focus every single day on how we can grow our economy, how we can increase exports, how we can make sure that even as we're buying goods from places like South Korea, we're also selling goods to places like South Korea.That's part of the reason why we think that getting this Korea-U.S. free trade agreement done is so important. And President Lee and I discussed this, and our instructions are we're not--we don't want months to pass before we get this done; we want this to be done in a matter of weeks.So bottom line is, Patricia, I think that when you see the final communique, it will reflect a broad-based consensus about the direction that we need to go. There may be on any given--at any given moment disagreements between countries in terms of particular strategies. That's not surprising because each country has unique problems and finds itself in different positions. Countries like Germany historically are very sensitive to issues like inflation. But I don't think you'll get any objection to their belief that if the U.S. isn't growing, that's not good for the rest of the world.It also doesn't negate the fact that if we--if individual countries are engaging in practices that are purposely designed to boost their exports at the expense of others, that that can contribute to problems as opposed to solving them.",

    "Well, let me repeat what I said earlier. I think that it is good for the region and good for the world if is successfully developing, if is lifting more of its people out of poverty. There are a lot of people in , and the more they're able to develop and provide basic needs for their people and work cooperatively with other countries in the region, that's only going to strengthen the region, that's not going to weaken it.I do think that, as President Aquino said very persuasively, that as a large country has already asserted that it is interested in abiding by international law. And really, our message to consistently on a whole range of issues is we want to be a partner with you in upholding international law. In fact, larger countries have a greater responsibility in abiding by international norms and rules because when we move, it can worry smaller countries if we don't do it in a way that's consistent with international law.And I think that there are going to be territorial disputes around the world. Look, some\u2014we have territorial disputes with some of our closest allies. I suspect that there are some islands and rocks in and around Canada and the United States where there are probably still some arguments dating back to the 1800s. But we don't go around sending ships and threatening folks. What we do is, we sit down, and we have some people in a room; it's boring, it's not exciting\u2014[]\u2014but it's usually a good way to work out these problems and work out these issues.And I think that all the countries that I've spoken to in the region during the course of my trip\u2014Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and now the Philippines\u2014their message has been the same everywhere I go, which is, they would like to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. That's why I think that the approach that President Aquino has been taking, putting this before international arbitration, is a sound one.And if , I think, listens to its neighbors and recognizes that there is another approach to resolve these disputes, what will find is they've got ready and willing partners throughout the Asia region\u2014Asia-Pacific region that want to work with them on trade and commerce and selling goods and buying goods. And it's inevitable that is going to be a dominant power in this region just by sheer size. Nobody, I think, denies that. The question is just whether other countries in the region are also able to succeed and prosper on their own terms and attend to the various interests and needs that they and their people have as well. And that's what we support. Well, I think our\u2014from the onset, our message to has been, I think, we're all focused on achieving greater prosperity for all our respective peoples, and prosperity and continued prosperity does not happen in a vacuum. There has to be stability. And in turn, they have responded that the disputes in the South Sea/West Philippine Sea are not the end all and be all of our relationships. And we have had good cooperation with them on so many different fronts, and perhaps one could even argue that this is the only sore point in our relationship.Now, having said that, perhaps, we have tried to work on that particular premise of building up our ties on different aspects where there is no conflict or very little conflict and, in this particular instance, trying to find the way and means by which we can both achieve our respective goals, which in\u2014which I believe are not\u2014or should not be\u2014mutually exclusive, but rather should be inclusive if at the end of the day, we do want to strive for the prosperity of our respective peoples.That, I think, has to be the primordial concern, rather than disputes on a few rocks that are not possible to be inhabited. And I think in due time, no, given the fact that there's so much commerce that traverses this particular\u2014both in the maritime and the air domain, no\u2014, which has achieved its goals of improving the life of its people, will see the soundness of this proposal and perhaps will act more, shall we say, consistently and actively towards achieving that stability for all. That is our hope. Final question comes from Ed Henry of FOX News.",
    "Well, first of all, let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.It has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional\u2014disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of Government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place.I recognize that there's some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or Embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind.So with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.What I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.And we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure our\u2014the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their Government is doing on their behalf.But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.Margaret Brennan [CBS News].",
    "Well, with respect to Libya, obviously the situation is evolving on the ground. And how quickly this transfer takes place will be determined by the recommendations of our commanding officers that the mission has been completed--the first phase of the mission has been completed.As I said, our initial focus is taking out Libyan air defenses so that a no-fly zone can operate effectively and aircraft and pilots of the coalition are not threatened when they're maintaining the no-fly zone. The second aspect of this is making sure that the humanitarian aspects of the mission can be met.But let me emphasize that we anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not a matter of weeks. And so I would expect that over the next several days, we'll have more information, and the Pentagon will be fully briefing the American people as well as the press on that issue.NATO will be involved in a coordinating function because of the extraordinary capacity of that alliance. But I will leave it to Admiral Mullen and those who are directly involved in the operation to describe to you how exactly that transfer might be--might take place.With respect to this new partnership, I don't want to give you all my best lines from my speech; otherwise, no one will come. [] But the thing that I'm most excited about is the fact that in a country like Chile, it's not just a matter of what we can give to Chile, it's also a matter of what Chile can offer us.Chile has done some very interesting work around clean energy, so we set up a clean energy partnership. We think we're doing terrific work on alternative energy sources, but there may be initiatives that are taking place here in Chile that might be transferrable to the United States.On education, obviously, we have a long history of public education, and our universities, I think, are second to none. But we want to make sure that in this increasingly integrated world, American students aren't just looking inwards, we're also looking outwards. And so the idea of us setting up a broad-based exchange program with the Americas, I think, makes an enormous difference.Security cooperation: The plague of narcotraffickers in the region is something that we're all too familiar with. And obviously, we have the example of Colombia that has made great strides in bringing security to a country that had been ravaged by drug wars. What lessons can we take and then apply them to smaller countries in Central America, for example, that are going through some of these same struggles?For Chile, the United States, Colombia, other countries to work in concert to help to train effective security operations in Central America to deal with narcotraffickers is a kind of collaboration that would not be as effective if the United States were operating on its own.So I think across the spectrum of issues that we care about deeply and that Chile care about deeply, what will characterize this new partnership is the fact that it's a two-way street. This is not just a situation where a highly developed country is helping a poor and impoverished country; this is a situation where an up-and-coming regional power that has a strong voice in international affairs is now collaborating with us to, hopefully, help greater peace and prosperity for the region and the world. . No doubt that insofar as integration of the Americas, we are lagging behind. And the best way to illustrate this is to compare what has happened in America with what happened in Europe.Last century, the Europeans had two World Wars that--with a toll of more than 70 million casualties. But at some point, they had the wisdom, the courage to abandon the rationale of Line Maginot or Siegfried Line and to embrace Maastricht Treaty. With the leadership and the vision of such renowned statesmen like Adenauer, De Gasperi, Haussmann, Schuman, they began to build what today we know of as European Union.And in America, we are much behind that. In America, 20 years ago, President Bush, father, raised the idea of a free trade area from Alaska to Fire Land [Tierra del Fuego]*, generating a lot of enthusiasm in the region, but it never came true, never materialized.And so the time is right now because Latin America has been for too long the continent of hope or of the future, but a continent cannot be a promise forever. And so we are of age now, and we need to fulfill our mission. Therefore, the main task of Latin America is to recover the lost time and tap all of its potential.We have lots of things in common with the U.S.: vast, generous territory, homogenous peoples, hard-working people. We don't have racial problems that affect some African countries or the wars that raged in Europe, nor the religious conflicts of Europe itself. And therefore Latin America is called to compromise, or rather commitment with its own fate.And therefore, we are looking forward to 's words. We are all left-handed--we have many coincidences--we studied in Harvard, both of us. We are sportsmen. continues to be a basketball player; I was in my time as well. I think the First Lady of the U.S. is very good-looking, and has said the same about the First Lady of Chile. There are plenty of coincidences, but the most important one is the one we'll find this afternoon.And modestly, if I could suggest to , we hope to have a partnership that is 2.0, a one where we have all responsibilities and not an existential alliance, because existentialism has never been enough to face the major problems, but rather, a partnership of collaboration between Latin America and the United States sharing values, principles, and a common vision.And that alliance should be comprehensive. It should reach out to the fields of democracy, freedom, rule of law, defense of human rights. And I think that we have to improve the democratic charter of OAS. It should also open up the doors to the free trade of goods and services, and faster than what we have done hitherto. And in addition to that, to include those subjects which are the true pillars of the 21st century: quality of education, science, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship. Therein lie the pillars for Latin America so as to leave poverty and antidevelopment behind.And we have so much to learn from a country like the United States that, in its 230 years of independent life, has really gave--has given true evidence of being an innovative country and that has made the largest contribution to progress of mankind.And thus, Latin America and the United States have a lot to gain from this alliance, but also has to reach out to two of the most important challenges of the 21st century: energy, to have clean, safe renewable energies; and water--if global warming keeps on going, could be the most scarce resource of our century. And also face the major problems of modern society that cannot be faced unilaterally: organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, the subject of world security. It can no longer be faced individually. We need to work jointly together.And in our view, that will call for a new international order that will replace that which emerged in Bretton Woods after the Second World War and to be appropriate and adaptive to the needs and challenges of the 21st century, where the only constant thing we have is change.So the time is right to recover all that lost time. And the time is here so that finally, this relationship of encounters, disencounters--of shaking hands or our backs--for that to be in the past. And let us initiate a new era of collaboration, reencountering frankly, effectively, concretely, that will truly face and solve the major problems; that will also open up the doors to tap the main opportunities. This society of knowledge and information is knocking on our doors.Latin America was late to the Industrial Revolution. We cannot be late in this tremendous revolution, which is so much deeper, which is that of knowledge and information. And it has been very generous with the countries that want to embrace it, but very cool with those countries that do not tap it.No child should be left behind; I've heard this from . And here, we say in Latin America, no country should be left behind.Thank you.",

    "Oh, well, they absolutely are a threat to us. They're a significant threat to us. I wouldn't be deploying young men and women into harm's way if I didn't think that they were an absolute threat to us.Now, General McChrystal's strategy, which I think is the right one, is that we are going to clear out Taliban strongholds, we are going to strengthen the capacity of the Afghan military, and we are going to get them stood up in a way that allows us then to start drawing down our troops, but continuing to provide support for Afghan in its effort to create a stable government.It is a difficult process. At the same time, we've also got to work with Pakistan so that they are more effective partners in dealing with the extremists that are within their borders. And it is a big, messy process. But we are making progress, in part because the young men and women under General McChrystal's supervision, as well as our coalition partners, are making enormous sacrifices, but also on the civilian side, we're starting to make progress in terms of building capacity that will allow us then to draw down with an effective partner.

Typically, what's happened is, is that we try to attach the G-8 summit to the NATO summit so that the leaders in the G-8 summit don't have to travel twice to whatever location. So, last year, in France, we combined a G-8 with a NATO summit. We'll do so again.I have to say, this was an idea that was brought to me after the initial organizing of the NATO summit. Somebody pointed out that I hadn't had any of my counterparts, who I've worked with now for 3 years, up to Camp David. G-8 tends to be a more informal setting in which we talk about a wide range of issues in a pretty intimate way. And the thinking was that people would enjoy being in a more casual backdrop.

    "I have got cordial relations with the leaders when I talk to them. I saw Speaker Pelosi last night at the Congressional Ball at the White House, and we have very cordial relations. Here's\u2014 Congress\u2014the Democrats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, need to work out their differences before they come to the White House. You can imagine what it's like to try to deal on an important piece of legislation, and the Democrats in the House have one opinion, and the Democrats in the Senate have another opinion. FISA is a good example.And in order for us to be able to reach accord, they've got to come with one voice, one position. And it's\u2014nobody\u2014like, the most disappointing thing about Washington has been the name-calling and this kind of\u2014people go out in front of the mikes, and they just kind of unleash. And I've tried hard not to do that. I've tried to be respectful to all parties. And that's disappointing.On the other hand, I think we can get some things done. The Peruvian trade vote is one; there's an example. And the Congress needs to get their differences sorted. One of the worst ways to negotiate is to negotiate with one group. They pocket your negotiations, and then another group shows up and says, Well, you've said this to them, now give us this.And hopefully, as we come down the stretch here, that they're capable of coming forward with, Here's what we believe; here's our plan; here's what we would like you to consider, as opposed to some examples, which is passing legislation for the sake of the headline, as opposed to passing legislation to get it passed. And SCHIP is a classic example. They knew I was going to veto the bill. They knew that was going to happen. They knew the veto would be sustained. But they ate up valuable time and passed the bill anyway.And so we sit here in the White House trying to figure out why. Why would you waste time? Why wouldn't you sit down and try to seriously negotiate an agreement on a bill that they knew was going to get vetoed and sustained?Now, hopefully, in the next\u2014however long they intend to stay here, that we're capable of working together. But if not, I'm going to stand strong for certain principles, and one of which is to make sure our troops get funded. We've got men and women in combat. We've got people risking their lives for the United States of America. And this Congress has yet to fund them, and it needs to. And it needs to fund them without telling our military how to conduct this war. Arbitrary dates for withdrawal are unacceptable, particularly given the fact that the strategy is working\u2014it's working.And it seems like to me that this Congress ought to be congratulating our military commanders and our troops. And one way to send a congratulatory message is to give them the funds they need, and now is the time to do it.Let's see here, Mark Silva [Chicago Tribune].",
    "Well, I know that there's some Republican candidates who won last night who feel very strongly about it. I'm sure that this will be an issue that comes up in discussions with the Republican leadership. As I said before, though, I think we'd be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next 2 years relitigate arguments that we had over the last 2 years.With respect to the health care law, generally--and this may go to some of the questions that Savannah was raising. When I talk to a woman from New Hampshire who doesn't have to mortgage her house because she got cancer and is seeking treatment, but now is able to get health insurance; when I talk to parents who are relieved that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they're 26 years old and give them a time to transition to find a job that will give them health insurance, or the small businesses that are now taking advantage of the tax credits that are provided, then I say to myself, this was the right thing to do.Now, if the Republicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system, if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to a health care system that has been wildly expensive for too many families and businesses and certainly for our Federal Government, I'm happy to consider some of those ideas.For example, I know one of the things that's come up is that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appears to be too burdensome for small businesses. It just involves too much paperwork, too much filing. It's probably counterproductive. It was designed to make sure that revenue was raised to help pay for some of the other provisions, but if it ends up just being so much trouble that small businesses find it difficult to manage, that's something that we should take a look at.So there are going to be examples where I think we can tweak and make improvements on the progress that we've made. That's true for any significant piece of legislation.But I don't think that if you ask the American people, should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole, that will help senior citizens get prescription drugs? Should we go back to a situation where people with preexisting conditions can't get health insurance? Should we allow insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick even though you've been paying premiums? I don't think that you'd have a strong vote for people saying those are provisions I want to eliminate.",

There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens aren't\u2014you know, are treated with respect. And that's what I want, and that's what most\u2014all Americans want.Now, let me talk about the phone companies. You cannot expect phone companies to participate if they feel like they're going to be sued. I mean, it is\u2014these people are responsible for shareholders; they're private companies. The Government said to those who have alleged to have helped us that it is in our national interests, and it's legal. It's in our national interests because we want to know who's calling who from overseas into America. We need to know in order to protect the people.It was legal. And now, all of a sudden, plaintiffs' attorneys, class-action plaintiffs' attorneys, you know\u2014I don't want to try to get inside their head; I suspect they see, you know, a financial gravy train\u2014are trying to sue these companies. And first, it's unfair. It is patently unfair. And secondly, these lawsuits create doubts amongst those who will\u2014whose help we need.I guess you could be relaxed about all this if you didn't think there was a true threat to the country. I know there's a threat to the country. And the American people expect our Congress to give the professionals the tools they need to listen to foreigners who may be calling into the United States with information that could cause us great harm. So, on the one hand, the civil liberties of our citizens are guaranteed by a lot of checks in the system and scrutinized by the United States Congress.And secondly, I cannot emphasize to you how important it is that the Congress solve this problem. The Senate has solved the problem. And people say, would you ever compromise on the issue? The Senate bill is a compromise. And there's enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill. It's a bipartisan bill. And the House leaders need to put it on the floor. Let the will of the House work. In my judgment, it happens to be the will of the people to give the professionals the tools they need to protect the country.Elaine [Elaine Quijano, Cable News Network].",
    "There's a fund into which we're contributing money. And I don't think you ought to be concerned about the source of the funding. What you ought to be focused on is whether or not the U.S. is willing to commit funds, along with the EU. And we are. And at the same time, we're willing to send messages to the Libya Government that we expect the release of the nurses. We've been very much in concert with your Government. This is an issue that we care about. And so\u2014but we do agree with the strategy that there ought to be some compensation for the Libyan children and their families. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you know that I have visited Libya; I have visited the hospital in Benghazi. I've spoken with the parents and the infected children, and I'm clearly aware of the great drama they're suffering, they're going through, and how much it needs to be done in order to invest in this hospital and in order to relieve the pain and suffering of both the children and their kin, and their families and friends.This is a Bulgarian; this is a European; this is a commitment of the entire democratic public, worldwide. By all means, Bulgaria and, I believe, our friends from the United States and the European Union consider this not a one-off, not a temporary\u2014an attempt to release the nurses, and then we quit. For us\u2014and I'm happy that this was\u2014we went along with George on this. For us, this is a long-term commitment. This is a commitment we take in respect of the both those suffering in Benghazi, but also everyone suffering of AIDS, not just in Benghazi, but in the whole of Africa. Let's remember G-8 and their decision: $60 billion were allocated to this policy by the world democratic community a few days ago.I, for one, 6 months ago, in addressing the European Parliament, I said\u2014and I appealed to the big players, so to speak, worldwide, in the businesses worldwide, to take a more\u2014a firmer commitment to this fund, to donate more, contribute more to this fund. In this sense, I join my voice and I welcome and I do support the appeal which the Bulgarian media have issued. I hope their voice will be heard. I know, whenever the media speak, their voice is heard more clearly than that of politicians.",
    "David, the first objective is to develop benchmarks that the Government agrees with and that we think are important. You can't\u2014it's really important for the American people to understand that to say, Okay, these are the benchmarks you must live with, is not going to work nearly as effectively as if we have\u2014when we have buy-in from the Government itself, the sovereign Government of Iraq.And so the step is to say to the Maliki Government\u2014which we're doing\u2014let us work in concert to develop a series of benchmarks to achieve different objectives. And the purpose of that is to assure the Iraqi people that this unity Government is going to work to\u2014for the improvement of the Iraqi people. In other words, it will be beneficial for the Government to say to the Iraqi people, Here is what we intend to do, and here's when we intend to do it.It will also be beneficial for the American people to be able to see that this is going to make the difficult decisions necessary to move forward, to achieve the goal. And that's what we're talking about when it comes to benchmarks. It's\u2014again, I repeat: One should not expect our Government to impose these benchmarks on a sovereign government. You'd expect us to work closely with that Government to come up with a way forward that the Government feels comfortable with. And there's probably going to be some bones of contention during these discussions, but nevertheless, we'll respect the fact that the Iraq Government is sovereign, and they must respect the fact that we've got patience but not unlimited patience.",
    "No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you\u2014and you may be aware or you've seen it\u2014we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.And secondly, we're in a situation where the\u2014let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, Okay, we have to make some cuts, would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income\u2014what was coming in the door\u2014to determine what you could afford?And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as\u2014as well as\u2014cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the\u2014my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are\u2014we've provided for the number of\u2014we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America\u2014very complicated stuff.It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between\u2014we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.And there's a lot of other\u2014for example, the idea that we're\u2014in terms of taxes\u2014that they refuse to\u2014for example, we\u2014I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill\u2014anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.And\u2014because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty\u2014$400 billion\u2014or $40 billion\u2014$400 billion\u2014that they\u2014they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to\u2014we went from somewhere\u2014roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continue\u2014we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.",
    "And it's a problem we want to solve.",
    "Yes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.We do have a situation. This is a\u2014these are changes in places where we're\u2014places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies\u2014poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs\u2014sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense\u2014National Defense Ministry.So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of help\u2014the situation in the United States\u2014deaths because of overdose of fentanyl.And\u2014but just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending life\u2014the life.As I was telling you\u2014I was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden\u2014their teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaigns\u2014publicity or propaganda campaigns\u2014in the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: Say no to drugs. Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thing\u2014public fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crime\u2014gangs of organized crimes.And this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and women\u2014all very good looking\u2014very handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.But we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.As I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapers\u2014yes, they say: Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.We did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, then\u2014this is being allowed.And there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that their\u2014our children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.But, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networks\u2014they should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.Well, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much.

You probably don't know this, but a lot of Americans were really, really touched and pleased to see what took place here.And I told the President that Ukraine is\u2014you know, has caught the imagination of a lot of our fellow citizens over the last decade or so, and that you'll have good friends. The key, of course, is to have government that's open, government that's transparent, government that's noncorrupt, government that actually listens to the voices of the people as it makes laws, which is what's happening.But no, this is a good trip, and I'm really thrilled to be here.

    "As you know, Mark, we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing, faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting, faster than was predicted even 5 years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily\u2014there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe.And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it.Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. That will have an impact. That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere. We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation. And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere. But we haven't done as much as we need to.So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can\u2014what more can we do to make in\u2014short-term progress in reducing carbons and then working through an education process that I think is necessary\u2014a discussion, a conversation across the country\u2014about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with.I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue, I also think there are regional differences. There's no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices. And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that. I won't go for that.If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support.So you can expect that you'll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward.",
    "I support a plan that says that there will be an independent judiciary analyzing every charge brought forth, and when someone is found guilty, there's punishment. That's the kind of plan I support. It happens to be the kind of plan the President supports. In other words, there's no political favorites when it comes to justice, that if someone is guilty, they will pay a penalty. And the best way to assure that that penalty is fair and the justice is fair is for there to be a court independent from politics.And so when I asked this very same question to the President about the news I've been reading in Washington, DC, the same questions he's going to be asked when he and his government come to talk to our Congress, he answered just like I described. He said: We have an independent court. We've got a firm law. People will be held to account, whether or not they're\u2014no matter what political party they may or may not be associated with. That's what the people of Colombia expect; that's the kind of justice they're going to receive.Listen, this country has come through some very difficult times.

    "Yes Well, first and foremost, let's understand what's happening in Syria and how we got here What started off as peaceful protests against Asad, the President, evolved into a civil war because Asad met those protests with unimaginable brutality And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictatorPoint number two is that the reason Asad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past They're just more overt about it They have been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because they've seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his countrySo in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive\u2014that keeps the State intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive\u2014and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr Asad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians This is not a judgment I'm making, it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians makeAnd I said to Mr Putin that I'd be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr Asad and Iran, a political transition\u2014we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution\u2014but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Asad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire And it won't work And they will be there for a while if they don't take a different courseI also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL But what was very clear\u2014and regardless of what Mr Putin said\u2014was that he doesn't distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr Asad go From their perspective, they're all terrorists And that's a recipe for disaster, and it's one that I rejectSo where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about deconfliction so that we're not seeing US and American [Russian; White House correction] firefights in the air But beyond that, we're very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Asad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people and that it has to stop And in order for it to stop, we're prepared to work with all the parties concerned But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr Asad's behaviorKeep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if we're ever going to have to have a political transition, we need And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are debilitated\u2014de-capacitated, and it's only strengthening ISIL And that's not good for anybodyIn terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldn't impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria, because eventually Syria will fall, the Asad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who we're working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country And so we will continue to support themThe training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country And I'm the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response we'd get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day we're having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime? And so it's been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when they've got bombs coming at them from the westSo what we're doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success\u2014for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out\u2014seeing if we can build on that But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that rightly believes, in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problemsNow, last point I just want to make about this, because sometimes, the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally: Mr Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength, but out of weakness, because his client, Mr Asad, was crumbling And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now he's got to put in his own planes and his own pilots And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there, I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly, the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind himIran and Asad make up Mr Putin's coalition at the moment The rest of the world makes up ours So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy It does not mean that we could not see Mr Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interests to broker a political settlement And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition, to come up with that political transition And nobody pretends that it's going to be easy, but I think it is still possible And so we will maintain lines of communicationBut we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that there's got to be a change in government We're not going to go back to the status quo ante And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive It's going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all\u2014that we all should be looking for",

General Petraeus will come back; he'll assess the situation\u2014come back to the United States\u2014and make further recommendations. I don't know what those recommendations will be. I have told the American people, though, that conditions on the ground, the situation in Iraq, should determine our troop levels.And so we are in the process of what's called return on success. And I had the honor of going to see the 82d Airborne that had been in Iraq, and they came home. And it was\u2014I was\u2014I am constantly amazed at the courage and the commitment of our troops. And I'm also pleased with the courage and commitment of the Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq. The situation is dramatically different than what it was a year ago. And United States and our allies must send a clear message to the Iraqis: We'll stand with them as their democracy continues to evolve and their economy continues to grow. And now my question: I'm very happy to acknowledge the forecast made by the President of Italy with regard to the attitude being shown by the opposition. And we are happy to think that the opposition might like to support our foreign policy, and our foreign policy will go along the same lines that we pursued in our previous Government for those 5 years.And this is a pro-European integration foreign policy. It is a foreign policy which is based on the idea that we don't have two Western worlds, we don't have Europe on one side and the U.S. and Canada on the other. When we talk about the West, we mean only one West. And our foreign policy aims at being based on cordial relations with an important country such as the Russian Federation.So our policy is going to require our effort to strengthen the ties and the cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation. And it is a policy that will consider NATO to be the vehicle which will help to maintain and uphold peace throughout the world, as it has done over the past decades.Now, what about the wounds in the world, at\u2014where we know that they're going to need our generosity? Democracies are going to have to help those people who cannot establish freedom on their own. And as I said earlier, we think that this is the only way that we can possibly pursue in order to enable and ensure peace throughout the world after having fully eliminated terrorism.Now let me also acknowledge your vision, Mr. President, your policy, and the courage that you have shown throughout all the years, of hard work on behalf\u2014 on the part of your administration. You've always expressed your ideas with great courage, your ideals for the future, your vision for the future. I have gotten to know President Bush very well. I consider him to be a very close friend, a very unique person. And when he says no, he means no; when he says yes, it means yes. And he's always known\u2014he's always shown that he has been able to be very close to those friends of his who have shared his ideals.I thank you very much, Mr. President, for your friendship between the two of us, on a personal level, your friendship shown to our country. And I thank you for the very courageous role that you have always taken as the leader of the most important country in the world and\u2014which is able to determine peace and freedom throughout the world.Thank you once again.

It was a total fabrication.He said, This is what . . .\u2014and the only ones that don't like my conversation are the ones that never read it. But they heard Shifty Schiff. That's what I call a lie. And because of the fact that he's\u2014he's lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says\u2014you know, I\u2014believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I'm a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely. And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad\u2014it was so evil. And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there's corruption involved.And just so you know, we've been investigating, on a personal basis\u2014through Rudy and others, lawyers\u2014corruption in the 2016 election. We've been investigating corruption, because I probably will\u2014I was going to definitely\u2014but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.",
    "Let me, first of all, address your second question about spying allegations. As a general rule, I don't comment on intelligence matters in a big room full of reporters. [] And I think I'll continue that tradition.But with respect to the possibility of an agreement that ensures that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, we have not just briefed Congress about the progress or lack thereof that's being made, but we also brief the Israelis and our other partners in the region and around the world. And if in fact an agreement is arrived at that we feel confident will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, it's going to be there for everybody to see. And people are going to be able to lift up the hood and see what's in there.So I have confidence that if there's an agreement, it's going to be a good agreement that's good for American security and Israeli security and the region's security. And if it isn't, then there probably won't be an agreement. So there will be, I think, significant transparency in the whole process.With respect to Israel's relations with the Palestinians, I think it's important to understand that the issue here is not what I believe, but it's what the Palestinians and the parties in the negotiations and the Israeli people believe is possible. That's the most important issue. I've said before, and I'll simply repeat: Prime Minister Netanyahu, in the election runup, stated that a Palestinian state would not occur while he was Prime Minister. And I took him at his word that that's what he meant, and I think that a lot of voters inside of Israel understood him to be saying that fairly unequivocally.Afterwards, he pointed out that he didn't say never, but that there would be a series of conditions in which a Palestinian state could potentially be created. But of course, the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet anytime soon. So even if you accepted, I think, the corrective of Prime Minister Netanyahu's in subsequent days, there still does not appear to be a prospect of a meaningful framework established that would lead to a Palestinian state even if there were a whole range of conditions and security requirements that might be phased in over a long period of time, which it was always the presumption.I don't think anybody ever envisioned in any peace agreement, certainly not one that Prime Minister Netanyahu would agree to or that the Israeli people would agree to, that overnight you suddenly have a Palestinian state right next to Jerusalem and that Israel would not have a whole range of security conditions that had to be met, and that it would be phased in over a long period of time.So the issue has never been, do you create a Palestinian state overnight? The question is, do you create a process and a framework that gives the Palestinians hope, the possibility, that down the road, they have a secure state of their own, standing side by side with a secure, fully recognized Jewish State of Israel?And I think\u2014it's not just my estimation\u2014I think it's hard to envision how that happens based on the Prime Minister's statements. And so when I said that we have to now do an evaluation of where we are, it's not in reference to our commitment to Israel's military edge in the region, Israel's security, our intelligence cooperation, our military cooperation. That continues unabated. And I will continue to do whatever I need to do to make sure that our friends in Israel are safe. That's what I've done since I've been President, and that's not going to stop. And so the Israeli people need to know that.But I am required to evaluate honestly how we manage Israeli-Palestinian relations over the next several years. Because up until this point, the premise has been, both under Republican and Democratic administrations, that as difficult as it was, as challenging as it was, the possibility of two states living side by side in peace and security could marginalize more extreme elements, bring together folks at the center and with some common sense, and we could resolve what has been a vexing issue and one that is ultimately a threat to Israel as well.And that possibility seems very dim. That may trigger, then, reactions by the Palestinians that, in turn, elicit counterreactions by the Israelis. And that could end up leading to a downward spiral of relations that will be dangerous for everybody and bad for everybody.So bottom line, just to summarize here: Number one, our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue unabated, unaffected, and we are absolutely committed to making sure that the Israeli people are safe, particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians.Number two, that the evaluation that's taking place is specific to what happens between Israelis and Palestinians going forward. We'll continue to engage the Israeli Government as well as the Palestinians and ask them where they are interested in going and how do they see this issue being resolved. But what we can't do is pretend that there's a possibility of something that's not there. And we can't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen at least in the next several years. That is something that we have to, for our own\u2014for the sake of our own credibility, I think we have to be able to be honest about that.And I guess one last point about this, because obviously, I've heard a lot of the commentary: There's a tendency, I think, in the reporting here to frame this somehow as a personal issue between myself and President\u2014Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I understand why that's done, because when you frame it in those terms, the notion is, well, if we all just get along and everybody cools down, then somehow the problem goes away. I have a very businesslike relationship with the Prime Minister. I've met with him more than any other world leader. I talk to him all the time. He is representing his country's interests the way he thinks he needs to, and I'm doing the same.So the issue is not a matter of relations between leaders; the issue is a very clear, substantive challenge. We believe that two states is the best path forward for Israel's security, for Palestinian aspirations, and for regional stability. That's our view, and that continues to be our view. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has a different approach. And so this can't be reduced to a matter of somehow let's all hold hands and sing Kumbaya. [] This is a matter of figuring out, how do we get through a real knotty policy difference that has great consequences for both countries and for the region? Okay?",
    "I think it's fine. I mean, I think they like me a lot in the U.K. I think they agree with me on immigration. I'm very strong on immigration. I made a point today\u2014I said: You've got to stop. You're ruining your\u2014you're going to have a lot of problems. You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration. I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.If you look at Italy, Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy. I think that a lot of the people in the U.K.\u2014I think that's why Brexit happened. Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation. Who knows? But\u2014and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention. I said I'm going to a few hotspots. We have NATO, then we have the U.K, and then we have Putin. And I said: Putin may be the easiest of them all. You never know. But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.But I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU\u2014the European Union\u2014better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they'd better be very, very careful. And I said that loud and clear.Yes, go ahead.",
    "Before. I think\u2014I think we'll have a deal before.",
    "Well, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.Number one, by insisting that we move our\u2014every one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.In addition to that, we find ourselves in a position that\u2014what we've done is that we have significantly reduced the\u2014for example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans were\u2014are\u2014were in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.We are in a position, as well, by\u2014we have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.For example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselves\u2014having railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirds\u2014the\u2014from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with less\u2014how can I say it?\u2014less carbon emissions.We're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.But there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is to\u2014for fuel\u2014for fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.And so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made to\u2014that we made in Paris. And I\u2014and we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same. Excellency, you said very rightly that, as far as India is concerned, the environment, climate, these are extremely important in our cultural traditions. For us, the environment is an article of faith. This is not just something that we need to do for convenience; we believe this.We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. In order for all of creation to work, we can make nature\u2014but we cannot have exploitation of nature, and we have always believed this.And on the basis of these values, we are not only doing things for ourselves, but are taking some global initiatives, as well. You perhaps know that the G-20 countries, the promises they made in Paris, of all the G-20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises it made at the G-20.Not just that, in the area of solar energy, in Glasgow, we had set ourselves a target to achieve 500 gigawatts of renewable energy. By 2030, we have set ourselves a target to make Indian railways net zero.And you must understand the scale of Indian railways. When we talk about Indian railways, it means that every day the entire population of Australia travels in our wagons\u2014in our railway wagons, on our trains. And we have set ourselves a target to achieve net zero for our railways.We have also set ourselves targets for solar energy, for ethanol\u201410 percent mix of ethanol. We have completed this target before the set date.We are also working in the area of green hydrogen. We want India to be a green hydrogen hub, and we are working towards this.In\u2014and the International Solar Alliance has been launched by India, and many countries have joined it and are working with India. The island countries, we have helped them in the area of solar energy so that they have now got a new confidence that we are with them in their efforts to fight climate change. And we will not only fulfill our responsibilities, but we will also help you in the area of climate change.We have seen that due to natural calamities\u2014people talk about the death of people, no doubt, when there are natural disasters, but there is a lot of destruction of infrastructure as well.And therefore, because of climate change, the kind of crisis we are feeling, we need to develop infrastructure that is resilient. And therefore, we have created a global organization called CDRI. And you perhaps know that in Glasgow I presented a subject to the world. And recently, it was launched by the U.N. Secretary General and myself. That is Mission LiFE. And when I say LiFE, I mean Lifestyle for the Environment. Therefore, every individual must live his life in a pro-environment, pro-development way. And we are working towards this.And I am sure that whatever work India has started in all these areas\u2014not because India has adversely affected the environment of the world; we are doing this because we have a concern for future generations. We do not want to give our future generations a world that make life difficult for them.And therefore, as a global responsibility, India has not caused any problems to the environment. However, we are playing a leading role in contributing in a positive manner.As far as prosperous countries are concerned, there's always been talk about technology transfer, financial support, and there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change. Thank you very much. Let me add one thing. We have caused damage in the United States the way we developed over the last 300 years. And that's why I was able to convince my colleagues in the Congress to pass legislation\u2014the largest climate fund ever in American\u2014in the world history: $369 billion\u2014$369 billion\u2014to deal with the climate crisis.And we are doing it extensively now, and I think you're going to see significant progress.Thank you all very, very much.[]",
    "I should have written all this down, Jackie. [] I'm running out of room here in my brain.",
    "Well, keep in mind my discussion with President Zardari was very brief, as we were walking into the summit, and I emphasized to him what we have emphasized publicly as well as privately. We think that has to be part of the solution in Afghanistan; that it is in our national interest to see a that is democratic, that is prosperous, and that is stable; that we share a common enemy in the extremists that are found not only in Afghanistan, but also within ; and that we need to work through some of the tensions that have inevitably arisen after 10 years of our military presence in that region. President Zardari shared with me his belief that these issues can get worked through. We didn't anticipate that the supply line issue was going to be resolved by this summit. We knew that before we arrived in Chicago, but we're actually making diligent progress on it.And I think ultimately everybody in the alliance, all of ISAF, and most importantly, the people of Afghanistan and understand that neither country is going to have the kind of security, stability, and prosperity that it needs unless they can resolve some of these outstanding issues and join in common purpose with the international community in making sure that these regions are not harboring extremists. So I don't want to paper over real challenges there. There is no doubt that there have been tensions between ISAF and , the United States and over the last several months. I think they are being worked through both military and diplomatic channels.But ultimately, it is in our interest to see a successful, stable , and it is in 's interest to work with us and the world community to ensure that they themselves are not consumed by extremism that is in their midst. And so we're going to keep on going at this. And I think every NATO member, every ISAF member is committed to that.Hans Nichols [Bloomberg News]. Where is Hans?",
    "I have to tell you, I think Chicago performed magnificently. Those of us who were in the summit had a great experience. If you talk to leaders from around the world, they love the city. Michelle took some of the spouses down to the South Side to see the Comer Center, where wonderful stuff is being done with early education. They saw the Art Institute.I was just talking to David Cameron. I think he's sneaking off and doing a little sightseeing before he heads home. I encouraged everybody to shop. I want to boost the hometown economy. We gave each leader a Bean--a small model--for them to remember, as well as a football from Soldier Field. Many of them did not know what to do with it. [] So people had a wonderful time, and I think the Chicagoans that they interacted with couldn't have been more gracious and more hospitable. So I could not have been prouder.Now, I think with respect to the protesters, as I said, this is part of what NATO defends, is free speech and the freedom of assembly. And frankly, to my Chicago press, outside of Chicago, folks really weren't all that stressed about the possibility of having some protesters here, because that's what--part of what America is about. And obviously, Rahm was stressed, but he performed wonderfully, and the Chicago police, Chicago's finest, did a great job under some significant pressure and a lot of scrutiny.The only other thing I'll say about this is thank you to everybody who endured the traffic situation. Obviously, Chicago residents who had difficulties getting home or getting to work or what have you, that's--what can I tell you, that's part of the price of being a world city. But this was a great showcase. And if it makes those folks feel any better, despite being 15 minutes away from my house, nobody would let me go home. I was thinking I would be able to sleep in my own bed tonight. They said I would cause even worse traffic. So I ended up staying in a hotel, which contributes to the Chicago economy.

    "Good. Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern. And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet. And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign.My simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy.I can't be sure of anything. I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people, but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world.And I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That's just the way this office works.And I've said before, if these issues were easy\u2014if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries\u2014if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President. And I'm a pretty good Presidential historian. I've looked at my 43 predecessors, and it seems like for all of them\u2014even the best ones\u2014that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate. I think the same will happen here. And that's a good thing. That's an important thing. With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting. We talked briefly while we were in between sessions. And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Asad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian cease-fire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort.And I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done. I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with France, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up. As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy.The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward. I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyber attacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack.I don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources\u2014both domestic, foreign, on social media\u2014that make it very difficult to voters\u2014for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. And let me put it this way. I think if we have a strong, accurate, and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much.If, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside. The issue is going to be what are we doing to ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something that we have control over.

And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off.

One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy.

    "Well, I think it's important to say, Carol, first of all, I haven't evolved in my assessment of the actual programs. I consistently have said that when I came into office, I evaluated them. Some of these programs I had been critical of when I was in the Senate. When I looked through specifically what was being done, my determination was that the two programs in particular that had been at issue, 215 and 702, offered valuable intelligence that helps us protect the American people, and they're worth preserving. What we also saw was that some bolts needed to be tightened up on some of the programs, so we initiated some additional oversight, reforms, compliance officers, audits, and so forth.And if you look at the reports\u2014even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward\u2014all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the Government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's e-mails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC.Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.\u2014Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be too if I wasn't inside the Government.And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released, drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something; in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry\u2014which is also impacted by this\u2014have a discussion with civil libertarians and see, can we do this better?I think the main thing I want to emphasize is, I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused.But people may have better ideas, and people may want to jigger slightly, sort of, the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that, if haven't already taken place, might take place in a future administration or as technologies develop further.And the other thing that's happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people don't have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that Government's not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what Government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance.And so those are the kinds of things that I'm looking forward to having a conversation about.",

    "Look, the only thing I'm confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely a Putin decision. Nobody else is going to make that decision; no one else is going to impact that decision. He's making that decision.And I suspect it matters which side of the bed he gets up on in the morning as to exactly what he's going to do. And I think it is not irrational, if he wanted to, to talk about dealing with strategic doctrine and dealing with force structures in Europe and in the European parts of Russia.But I don't know if he's decided he wants to do that or not. So far, in the three meetings we've had\u2014OSCE and\u2014anyway\u2014have not produced anything because the impression I get from my Secretary of State, my National Security Adviser, and my other senior officials that are doing these meetings is that there's a question of whether the people they're talking to know what he's going to do.So the answer is\u2014but based on a number of criteria as to what he could do\u2014for example, for him to move in and occupy the whole country, particularly from the north, from Belarus, it's\u2014he's going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.To move in a direction where he wants to talk about what's going\u2014we have\u2014we're continuing to provide for defense capacities to the Ukrainians.

    "Well, first of all, Julianna, let's take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn't say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was we weren't going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and we didn't. Now, you can argue that during the campaign, I saidI set the criteria for wealthy at 250, and we ended up being at 400. But the fact of the matter is millionaires, billionaires, are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a Tax Code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure that middle class taxes did not go up.The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made, and we've made those cuts.Now, the challenge going forward is that we've now made some big cuts, and if we're going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way.The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we've made on things like Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we've made to make sure that seniors don't go into poverty or that children who are disabled are properly cared for. For us to change that contract we've made with the American people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don't need, that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this Government, which is, is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people; that you don't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy.Another way of putting it is, we've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now wenow is as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there's really no stopping the principle. I mean, literallyeven in divided government, even where we've got a Democratic President and a Democratic Senatethat a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say every 2 months, every 3 months, every 6 months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise, we're going to have America not pay its bills. And that is no way for us to do business.And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican President and a Republican Senate, and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way 100 percent of the time, or otherwise, we are going to default on America's obligations.",
    "The United States has always had a pretty sacred rule, and that is, we don't leave our men or women in uniform behind. And that dates back to the earliest days of our Revolution.We have consulted with Congress for quite some time about the possibility that we might need to execute a prisoner exchange in order to recover Sergeant Bergdahl. We saw an opportunity. We were concerned about Sergeant Bergdahl's health. We had the cooperation of the Qataris to execute an exchange, and we seized that opportunity. And the process was truncated because we wanted to make sure that we did not miss that window.With respect to the circumstances of Sergeant Bergdahl's capture by the Taliban, we obviously have not been interrogating Sergeant Bergdahl. He is recovering from 5 years of captivity with the Taliban. He's having to undergo a whole battery of tests, and he is going to have to undergo a significant transition back into life. He has not even met with his family yet, which indicates, I think, the degree to which we take this transition process seriously, something that we learned from the Vietnam era.But let me just make a very simple point here, and that is, regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he's held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that. And that's what every mom and dad who sees a son or daughter sent over into war theater should expect from not just their Commander in Chief, but the United States of America.In terms of potential threats, the release of the Taliban who were being held in Guantanamo was conditioned on the Qataris keeping eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities. We will be keeping eyes on them. Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely. That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There is a certain recidivism rate that takes place. I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security. And we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging activities that threaten our defenses.But this is what happens at the end of wars. That was true for George Washington, that was true for Abraham Lincoln, that was true for FDR, that's been true of every combat situation, that at some point, you make sure that you try to get your folks back. And that's the right thing to do.",

    "Well, I don't think I've minimized the benefits, I think I've described the benefits. If\u2014at issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada. That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf. Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world.So there's no\u2014I won't say no\u2014there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices, what the average American consumer cares about, by having this pipeline come through. And sometimes, the way this gets sold is, let's get this oil, and it's going to come here. And the implication is, is that's going to oil\u2014lower gas prices here in the United States. It's not. There's a global oil market. It's very good for Canadian oil companies, and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it's not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers. It's not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs. Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens. There's probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf. Those aren't completely insignificant; if\u2014it's just like any other project. But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country, something that Congress could authorize, we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs or a million jobs. So if that's the argument, there are a lot of more direct ways to create well-paying American construction jobs.And then, with respect to the costs, all I've said is that I want to make sure that if in fact this project goes forward, that it's not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people, some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless. If we've got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.And as we're now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we're having to consider, how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing and so forth along the Jersey Shore? That's an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it. So, in terms of process, you've got a Nebraska judge that's still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate. Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.But I've just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there's been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula and\u2014to what ails the U.S. economy, and it's hard to see on paper where exactly they're getting that information from.In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won't have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks. When gas prices are lower, maybe they're more\u2014less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices. But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market. And that's what determines oil prices, ultimately.",
    "I mean, look, I'm going to meet with President Putin to make it clear to him the cold war is over and Russia is not our enemy and that there's common ground. Obviously, I've had my disagreements with the President in the past, and\u2014 but there's also areas where we need to work in common, such as proliferation and dealing with terror. And I've got some convincing to do, but he needs to understand, the missile defense system is aimed at\u2014 aimed primarily at rogue regimes coming out of the Middle East that could hold us all hostage. And this is a good\u2014it's a good chance for me to sit down and have yet another heart-to-heart with him. And I'm more than happy to do so.I made it clear yesterday that NATO needs to look at expansion in our interests, not\u2014and not give any nation a veto power over whether or not NATO ought to extend MAP membership and/or membership. And so it's\u2014you know, I understand Russian concerns about the expanse of NATO. They were concerned when Romania got into NATO, I'm confident. But look what a great partner and a peaceful neighbor Romania is. I mean, Romania has no warlike aspirations. These are people who want to help other democracies thrive and, at the same time, see their economy grow. I've explained to President Putin: Democracies on the border of Russia are in their interest.And so this is a good opportunity. I don't mind a good, frank discussion with President Putin. He doesn't mind telling me what's on his mind either. We've had 7 years working together, a chance to have some pretty candid exchanges. And secondly\u2014and this is his last\u2014this will be our last face-to-face meeting as his Presidency. And I'll thank him. I'll thank him for being candid with me. I'll thank him for serving his nation. I have no animosity toward President Putin. Just because you don't agree on issues doesn't mean you can't find a cordiality, to be able to discuss things in a frank manner, and that's the way our relationship has been. We\u2014I met with him a lot in the course of my Presidency, and I appreciate the fact that he invited me to Sochi.And so I have no\u2014I'm not going to set any kind of expectations. I guess you are. You call it a diplomatic train wreck; I call it an opportunity to sit down and have a good, frank discussion again. And we'll see what happens, what comes out of it. It's a good opportunity for me to say goodbye and to see whether or not we can sign the strategic dialogue that will serve our nations' interest after his Presidency and mine. From our point of view\u2014and I would like to make a comment here that does not necessarily answer your question\u2014but Romania has a relatively simple approach in relation to its ties with Russia. Firstly, we have to admit that all\u2014 we all, and particularly the former Communist states, must equally and perhaps more\u2014to a larger extent, Russia, we all have to overcome the logics of the cold war, because at present, there is nothing to justify this approach, this logic. Each independent state is free to have its options, and nobody can have the right\u2014the veto right upon the options of an independent state.But apart from this statement that regards more the principles, I would like to point out\u2014to refer to some issues that from our point of view are threats. For example, terrorist is a threat equally for Russia, for America, for Spain, and it can materialize at any time against Ukraine, against Georgia. So I would like to\u2014I could say that in this point, in this respect, we are all at the same level of risk.The trafficking in arms is an equal threat for the Russian Federation, for the United States, for Romania, for Ukraine, for Georgia, for Albania as well. This is another issue that we have to fight against together. The trafficking in narcotics that transforms into money for arms and into generations of youth that are deeply affected\u2014this threat affects equally the Russian Federation, Romania, America, France, Germany. Trafficking in human beings is another risk that affects equally Russia, America, Ukraine, Romania. And a possible cyber attack can be deployed with an equal risk for Russia, for Romania, for America. Missile attacks that are deployed by countries that do not respect the rules, that are not part of the proliferation treaties\u2014this risk can affect, at any time, the Russian Federation, America, Romania, Ukraine.Seeing\u2014finding that the risks are the same, are almost similar for everybody, why can't we find a common ground for solidarity between us, among us\u2014NATO member states, Russia Federation, aspiring NATO states\u2014a common ground for generating the same policy? Actually, the only thing that hinders us from acting united against the risks that affect us equally is the fact that some of us are still attached to the logics, to the approach of the cold war, and do not have an equal respect for the democratic rights of the peoples.",
    "Just because there was a bunch of, you know, Soviet-era flags in the street yesterday doesn't\u2014you shouldn't read anything into that. I\u2014look, this is an interesting debate that's taking place. And it's\u2014you know, as every nation has told me, Russia will not have a veto over what happens at Bucharest, and I take their word for it. And that's the right policy to have.I'm going to work as hard as I can to see to it that Ukraine and Georgia are accepted into MAP. I think it's in our interests as NATO members, and I think it's in Ukrainian and Georgian interests as well.And on missile defense, we'll see. I've made it abundantly clear to the\u2014President Putin that the missile defense system is not aimed at defending against Russia. After all, Russia could easily overwhelm the missile defense systems that we have in\u2014that we've envisioned. These systems are aimed at a nation out of the Middle East, for example, that could launch an attack against Europe and\u2014just like our systems out in the Far East are aimed at helping protect ourselves from single-or dual-launch regimes.So obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to allay suspicions and old fears, but I believe we're making pretty good progress along those lines. When we're speaking about Ukrainian politics of joining the MAP and NATO membership, I would like to mention a couple basic things. First, this is not a policy against somebody. We are taking care of our national interest.Taking a look at our history, it's very rich in many tragedies for Ukrainian state that only the system of collective defense and security\u2014international guarantees of the political sovereignty for Ukraine and territorial integrity will give the full response to the internal question in Ukraine. And I'm sure that for any Ukrainian who takes care of the future for Ukraine, a stable future for Ukraine, the issue of joining MAP is probably the most high-quality response to all the basic and fundamental interests of Ukraine.Secondly, I would like the debates that are now being carried out in Europe and in the world regarding Ukraine's prospects of joining the MAP and then after, NATO\u2014form any new obstacle. I'm sure that we are going\u2014we're taking the right track, and we are acting within the framework of our national sovereignty. Our nation is determined, and it corresponds to our political reasonability for the security of the state.I would like the basic and fundamental principle of work of the alliance\u2014I mean, the open door policy would be replaced by the veto right by the country which is not even a member of the alliance. I'm sure that we're witnessing a very hot and overheated emotional discussion where there are few rules or even sometimes very little respect. But at the end of the day, the wisdom should win.And I want to firmly state that I'm only governed by a single issue. I want to bring calmness, stability, and security stability, in particular we\u2014to this state. We want to be speaking about the Ukrainian presence in the world. We want to speak about the internal country. That's why only through these motives shall we want to have that dialogue, the talks.And what we have in our society\u2014I mean, the part of the political forces who do not share this opinion\u2014I think that this is all natural, because it's quite natural that today, like, hundreds\u2014some hundreds of people and red flags were in the square. This is a remarkable because the Ukrainian famine was built under the same flags as the Ukrainian oppression. These were the flags that caused totalitarianism and sufferings that caused many deaths of millions of people. And I'm sure that the Ukrainian Communist Party may also appear one day in Ukraine that will be standing under the flags of the nation. But apparently we still need to have another Moses to bring people over the desert for 40 years, for those who lost national interest and forgot about it and continue living in the past. I don't want this personality, in person, and I just want to show my vision and the ideology.",

    "Well, I'll answer first. Yes, I am satisfied. They have been very accommodating. They weren't at the beginning, and they have been since then.And I want to just thank the Italian Government and your Prime Minister, actually, in addition to the President. But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend, and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied. And we just discussed the same conversation with the President. We're very satisfied. Thank you. As far as the topic of tariffs is concernedtariffs following the WTO decision on the EU's contribution, or the subsidies to the Airbus consortiumI already mentioned what our belief is. Let me repeat it:I think that within the transatlantic relationship, and with the friendship that there has always been between the U.S. and the EU, it would be preferable to discuss our respective positions so that we can find a solution which takes into account the requirements of both parties. And that's wholly possible.The alternative would be that of imposing tariffs. Currently, following the WTO's decision concerning Airbus, wethere may be tariffs. And there may be tariffs in 6 months' time concerning the subsidies given to Boeing. This is a mere race between tariffs and mutual tariffs. I think it would be best to meet and to deal with our mutual needs so that a solution can be found.But if we don't do this now, it will have to be done soon. And I believe it would be best to find a solution immediately, instead of imposing tariffs, which would lead to other tariffs, and that would be a damage to both our economies. Well, actually, the tariff situation is interesting because we justit's like I said with China, and it turned out to be truewe cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States and, in this case, the European Union. Also true with China. That turned out to be right. We've collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We've given some to the farmers, to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won't be able to produce even that much, but I think they will, because they're incredible, ingenious. As I say, jokingly, but probably not jokingly: They'll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they're doing right now. But the farmers come out so well.But in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can't lose that, because they do much more business than we do, and that's unfortunate. But the word reciprocity is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semicomplicated, complicatedto me, not complicated at allthings that we're doing, it's got to be reciprocal, and it's not.The European Union has taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come throughone way or the otherthrough the European Union. That's the good news. The bad news is they've been very smart. They've been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he's leaving, but he's beenhe's been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.And so that's changing now. But we can't lose that particular war of tariffs, because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It's tremendous. And if you look at what they don't havethe barriers that they put up; they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europetremendous barriersboth from a monetary standpoint and what they call nonmonetary barriers.It's a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes. They send BMW. Then they send Volkswagen; Renault, in the case of France. So it's a very tough situation for us for many years, but now it's a very tough situation for them. Because I can remedy the situation very easily, and there really is not any financial counterattack. Hopefully, I don't have to do that.We arewith all of the being said, we are talking. We're talking with some new people in Europe, and I hope it's going to be successful; that way, we don't have to talk about it or worry about it, because our relationship should be a great one. But we have to be treated fairly on NATO, and we have to be treated fairly on trade with the European Union.Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
    "Well, first of all, we have had a consistent, unbreakable bond between the leaders of Europe over the last several decades, and it's across many dimensions: economic, military, counterterrorism, cultural. And so any one issue can be an irritant in the relationship between the countries, but it doesn't define those relationships. And that continues to be the case, and that has been the case throughout the last couple of years.As I said in a speech that I gave earlier this year, the United States is very proud of its record of working with countries around the world to prevent terrorism or nuclear proliferation or human trafficking or a whole host of issues that all of us I think would be concerned about. Intelligence plays a critical role in that process.What we've seen is that as technology has evolved, the guidelines and structures that constrain how our intelligence agencies operated have not kept pace with these advances in technology. And although, having examined over the last year, year and a half what's been done, I'm confident that everybody in our intelligence agencies operates in the best of intentions and is not snooping into the privacy of ordinary Dutch, German, French, or American citizens. What is true is, is that there is a danger because of these new technologies that at some point, it could be abused. And that's why I initiated a broad-based review of what we could do.There are a couple of things that we did that are unprecedented. In my speech, I announced that, for the first time, under my direction, that we are going to treat the privacy concerns of non-U.S. persons as seriously as we are the constraints that already exist by law on U.S. persons. We're doing that not because we're bound by international law, but because ultimately, it's the right thing to do.With respect to some of the aspects of data collection, what I've been very clear about is, is that there has to be a narrow purpose to it, not a broad-based purpose; but it's rather based on a specific concern around terrorism or counterproliferation or human trafficking or something that I think all of us would say has to be pursued.And so what I've tried to do then is to make sure that my intelligence teams are consulting very closely at each stage with their counterparts in other nations so that there's greater transparency in terms of what exactly we're doing, what we're not doing. Some of the reporting here in Europe, as well as the United States, frankly, has been pretty sensationalized. I think the fears about our privacy in this age of the Internet and big data are justified. I think the actual facts\u2014people would have an assurance if\u2014that if you are just the ordinary citizen in any of these countries, that your privacy, in fact, is not being invaded on. But I recognize that because of these revelations, that there's a process that's taking place where we have to win back the trust not just of governments, but more importantly, of ordinary citizens. And that's not going to happen overnight, because I think that there's a tendency to be skeptical of government and to be skeptical in particular of U.S. intelligence services. And so it's going be necessary for us\u2014the step we took that was announced today, I think, is an example of us slowly, systematically putting in more checks, balances, legal processes.The good news is that I'm very confident that it can be achieved, and I'm also confident that the core values that America has always believed in, in terms of privacy, rule of law, individual rights, that that has guided the United States for many years and it will continue to guide us into the future. Okay?Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you again.",

Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don't need a 20-percent or a 25-percent tax. But we're very close. I think we're going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not.We're going to have a deal, a really fair deal. But the EU is another one. We've been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That's a lot of money.

I think Page\u2014Lisa Page, his lover\u2014is a disgrace to our country. I think that when you look at McCabe, where his wife got $700,000 in campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton\u2014right?And then Hillary Clinton is under investigation, and yet she paid the head of the FBI\u2014one of the top people, but actually the head, because he took over for the other guy, who fortunately I fired. I made a good move when I fired. That was a smart move, because they were looking to take down this administration, duly elected administration. So I fired him. That was a great move when I fired him. Because maybe, if I didn't, I wouldn't be here talking to you as President.But when McCabe's wife gets $700,000 in campaign contributions when she was running for whatever office she was running from\u2014from Virginia\u2014and yet he's in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now, he says, Well, I wasn't really in charge. Of course, he was in charge. He was totally in charge. He knew exactly what was going on.These people got caught in the\u2014probably the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught.Now, what the Durham report is going to say, I can't tell you. But if they say half as much as I already know\u2014just from seeing it. You know, you have people\u2014I watch some of the shows. I watch Liz McDonald; she's fantastic. I watched Fox Business. I watched Lou Dobbs last night, Sean Hannity last night, Tucker last night, Laura. I watched Fox and Friends in the morning. You watch these shows; you don't have to go too far into the details. They cover things that are\u2014it's really an amazing thing.They got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They were spying on their opponent's campaign. Not only spying; they were making up fake dossiers. You have the dirty dossier. They were making up the dirty\u2014and it was all made up. It was all fiction. It turned out to be fiction. And then, they were using that in the FISA courts\u2014this revered court. Well, it's not so revered anymore, because when you look at what they did and how they played it\u2014and they hurt a lot of people.General Flynn is still being hurt, and he's being hurt very badly. He's a wonderful person. I spoke to General Milley about General Flynn 2 weeks ago. I said, What do you think of General Flynn? He said: He's a great soldier, sir. And he's a wonderful, wonderful human being. He's been destroyed. He's been destroyed. No, I think that this\u2014without knowing anything about what Durham is going to release\u2014the Durham report, we'll call it, or maybe it's going to be more than a report. Maybe it's going to be much more than a report, I don't know. Maybe it's a report or maybe it's much more than that.But when I look at the\u2014the things that everybody in this room knows, just from reading about it from yourselves back and forth, I think it's a disgrace to our country. And I think if people don't pay a very, very substantial price, it will happen again. And this should never ever happen to another President.Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.",

    "I'm the kind of person that likes people to say something and then do it; then we'll react. Words are easy to say in politics, in the international diplomacy. If they really want to help stabilize Iraq, there are things for them to do, such as cutting off weapon flows and/or the flow of suicide bombers into Iraq. There's all kind of ways to measure whether they're serious about the words they uttered. We, of course, welcome those words. Those are nice statements. And now they can act on them.I thought the conference\u2014well, first of all, I thought the conference got people in the neighborhood to say positive things about the young democracy. In other words, people are now committed publicly to helping Iraq, which was, I thought, very positive. I think the other benefit from the conference is, is that the government gained some confidence. In other words, this young democracy had nations from around the neighborhood and around the world come and talk to them in a way that was constructive and positive.Part of the success in Iraq is going to be whether or not this government has got the confidence necessary to make hard decisions. They're learning what democracy is all about. They've come from a tyranny to democracy in a pretty quick period of time. And I believe the conference will give the different factions inside Iraq the confidence necessary to do the hard things to reconcile and the government the confidence necessary to make the decision so that reconciliation can happen.So it was a positive outcome. And in terms of the expectations of the next meetings, we'll see. But the point is, is that the momentum made in the first one can be carried over to the second one. Secretary Rice will be going to that meeting. In other words, it's a step up in\u2014I'm not dissing anybody, but it's a step up in the pay grade; let's put it that way. [] And I think\u2014and I think Condi is going to\u2014will take an agenda that will help advance this young democracy, and she's going to work with the other nations to do so.. Gracias, President.

And they probably, certainly, didn't want to see it happen at this point.But it's a big package. It's a great package. And I think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars; it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We're going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there, but they changed the tax situation; they ripped it out. So they really ripped apart the island, and we're going to bring it back, John.",

And I can understand that. And I\u2014and that's one reason I go out of my way to constantly thank the family members. You know, I'm asking\u2014you're obviously talking to certain people\u2014or a person. I'm talking to our commanders. Their job is to tell me what\u2014 the situation on the ground.

    "That's all? [] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in\u2014on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.With regard to am I confident?\u2014I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms\u2014[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten\u2014we've each committed\u2014I trust the members of\u2014the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience\u2014but reconciliation\u2014that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.Today\u2014I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get\u2014if you're making less than $150,000\u2014you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get\u2014in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth\u201412 months divided\u2014$3,600\u2014$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty\u2014child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who\u2014what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours\u2014needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic\u2014we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible\u2014which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree. And\u2014but we're overcoming. We're putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.I'm sorry. I call on Ms. Sch\u00e4uble from Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. Thank you.[]",
    "Well, first of all, I'm very much looking forward to seeing President Bachelet. I think she's one of the finest leaders in Latin America, a very capable person. If you look at how Chile has handled the recession, they've handled it very well, in part because the surpluses that they got when copper prices were very high they set aside. And so they had a--the resources to deal with the downturn. It's a good lesson for the United States. When we had surpluses, they got dissipated.We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin America generally. One of the things that I'll be talking about with President Bachelet is the coordination and cooperation between the United State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcement when we do our press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energy partnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on cancer research. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. So--and by the way, Chile has actually entered into some very interesting partnerships, not just with the Federal Government but also with State governments like California.So I think the relationship that we have with Chile--which, by the way, does not fall in line with U.S. foreign policy on every single issue--but it's a respectful policy. Chile is an important partner. I think that's the model that we want: partnership. The United States doesn't dictate how Chile should view its own interests, but in fact, we've achieved great cooperation. And I will be looking at President Bachelet giving us further advice in terms of how we can take the kind of relationship we have with Chile and expand that to our relationships throughout Latin America. Okay?",
    "Well, on the specific question of how we can work with the Chilean Government, any requests that are made by Chile to obtain more information about the past is something that we will certainly consider, and we would like to cooperate. I think it's very important for all of us to know our history. And obviously, the history of relations between the United States and Latin America have at times been extremely rocky and have at times been difficult.I think it's important, though, for us, even as we understand our history and gain clarity about our history, that we're not trapped by our history. And the fact of the matter is, is that over the last two decades, we've seen extraordinary progress here in Chile, and that has not been impeded by the United States, but, in fact, has been fully supported by the United States.So I can't speak to all of the policies of the past. I can speak certainly to the policies of the present and the future. And as President of the United States, what I know is that our firm commitment to democracy, our firm commitment to eradicating poverty, our full commitment to broad-based and socially inclusive development, our full support of the robust, open markets that have developed here in Chile and the work that and his predecessor, President Bachelet, have done in order to transform the economic situation here--those are all things that the United States strongly supports.And so again, it's important for us to learn from our history, to understand our history, but not be trapped by it, because we've got a lot of challenges now, and even more importantly, we have challenges in the future that we have to attend to.",

    "I take Mitch McConnell at his word when he says that the Government is not going to shut down. There is no reason for it to shut down. We traveled down that path before. It was bad for the country, it was bad for every elected official in Washington. And at the end of the day, it was resolved in the same way that it would have been resolved if we hadn't shut the Government down. So that's not going to be productive, and I think that Leader McConnell and Speaker Boehner understand that.But this goes to a broader point that I've made previously and I'll just reiterate: It is in the nature of democracy that the parties are going to disagree on certain issues. And in our system, because we don't have a parliamentary system, it means that you can have a Congress of one party and a President of another, and they disagree on some really fundamental issues. And the question then is, how do you deal with that? Well, the sensible way to deal with it is to say here are the issues we don't agree on, and we'll fight like heck for our position, and then, we'll work together on the issues that we do agree on. And that's how it's always been; that's how it was with Ronald Reagan when he was dealing with a Democratic Congress. There was no\u2014at no point did the Democrats say, well, because we don't agree with Ronald Reagan on XYZ issue, then we can't work with him on Social Security reform or tax reform or other issues. He said, okay, we'll fight on that, we'll join together on that, and as a consequence, the country will make progress.And I would expect that same attitude in this instance. I understand that there are members of the Republican Party who deeply disagree with me and law enforcement and the evangelical community and a number of their own Republican colleagues about the need for immigration reform. I get that. And they've made their views clear, and there's nothing wrong with them arguing their position and opposing legislation. But why they would then decide we're going to shut down the Government makes about as much sense as my decision to shut down the Government if they decide to take a vote to repeal health care reform for the\u2014is it 53d or 55th time?

    "Because they're able to negotiate for higher wages, and they move from one job to another. That's one of the reasons why.

They're working like hell and not getting paid a whole lot.And so what you're seeing here is a combination of the desire of people to be able to change professions, to be able to do more and take care of their families, and at the same time, dealing with the issue that, in fact, we are short of workers.But worker pay has actually gone up. And we've employed 6 million people just since I got elected. So employment is up. The economy is actually, in spite of all this, still growing. You have the significant number of\u2014I forget the number; I think it was close to six\u201416 major economists acknowledging that what's going to happen is, you're going to see continued economic growth under our proposals.

So many pieces on the table are moving. And how they get resettled depends upon the judgments we make and whether or not the United States, among others, can lead the world in a direction that's going to increase the circumstances for a higher standard of living for workers here and abroad, as well as making sure that people have an opportunity. As I said\u2014again, I use the phrase\u2014just have a little breathing room.I meant what I said when I ran. My desire was to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.

An awful lot of the very factories and\u2014and operations that, in fact, produced material that we need for supply chains, in everything from shoes to dealing with computer chips, you know, they're out sick; they're not working.And so it's changing.

    "Please, go ahead. It is something that we discussed in our meeting. I mean, clearly there's a discussion going on between the British and the Americans about this, and I don't want to prejudice those discussions. We completely understand that Gary McKinnon stands accused of a very important and significant crime in terms of hacking into vital databases. And nobody denies that that is an important crime that has to be considered. But I have had conversations with the U.S. Ambassador, as well as raising it today with the President, about this issue, and I hope a way through can be found. Well, one of the things that David and I discussed was the increasing challenge that we're going to face as a consequence of the Internet and the need for us to cooperate extensively on issues of cybersecurity.We had a brief discussion about the fact that although there may still be efforts to send in spies and try to obtain state secrets through traditional cold war methods, the truth of the matter is, these days, where we're going to see enormous amounts of vulnerability when it comes to information is going to be through these kind of breaches in our information systems. So we take this very seriously. And I know that the British Government does as well.Beyond that, one of the traditions we have is the President doesn't get involved in decisions around prosecutions, extradition matters. So what I expect is that my team will follow the law, but they will also coordinate closely with what we've just stated is an ally that is unparalleled in terms of our cooperative relationship. And I trust that this will get resolved in a way that underscores the seriousness of the issue, but also underscores the fact that we work together and we can find an appropriate solution.All right?

    "As you know, we have been discussing this issue a lot at these press avails. Iran is constantly on the agenda at a press avail like this\u2014or a press conference like this, and the reason why is, is because they continue to be defiant as to the demands of the free world. The world has spoken and said, no nuclear weapons programs. And yet they're constantly ignoring the demands.My view is that we need to strengthen our sanction regime. I just spoke to Condoleezza Rice, and we will work with our European partners to develop further sanctions. And, of course, I will discuss this issue with Vladimir Putin as well as President Hu Jintao.The first thing that these leaders have got to understand is that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing for the world. It's in their interests that we work collaboratively to continue to isolate that regime.I'm sympathetic for the people of Iran. I'm sorry they live under a Government that continues to insist upon a program that the world has condemned, because it is denying the good people of Iran economic opportunities that they would have. This is a country with a great tradition and a great history. There are hard-working people in that country that want to benefit from a society that is more open, and yet the Government insists upon measures that will lead to further isolation. And therefore, to answer your\u2014one part of your question, we will work with our partners to continue the pressure.Secondly, obviously, to the extent that these people are picking up innocent Americans, it's unacceptable.

    "One of the great things about our democracy is, it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting. I've been the subject of protests during the course of my 8 years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign\u2014I wouldn't advise them to be silent.What I would advise\u2014what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election\u2014is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter. And what I consistently say to young people\u2014I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe\u2014do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life.I think there is a tendency\u2014because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up\u2014there is a tendency, I think, to assume that that's always the case. And it's not. Democracy is hard work.In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not\u2014and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones\u2014if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there's an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks.It's hard work. And the good news is, I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward.But I do think sometimes there's complacency. Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the cold war, who forget what it meant to have a wall. And I'll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where an easy equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate\u2014where those distinctions aren't made. I've said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws; we've operated imperfectly. There are times when we've made mistakes. There are times where I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with. It's a work of constant improvement.But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties and an independent judiciary and fighting corruption, those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country, but also with respect to our foreign policy.And that should be remembered. Because at an age where there's so much active misinformation\u2014and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television\u2014where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And you\u2014we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.That was a long answer, wasn't it? I don't remember if I\u2014there was a second part to it. I was\u2014I got all caught up in that one [].",

    "Well, look, as I have told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are\u2014a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the\u2014you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.But when you're under audit\u2014and I'm on a very continuous audit, because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company\u2014far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a great company, but it's big, and it's complex. And it's probably feet high. It's a very complex instrument.And I think that people wouldn't understand it. But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit. And really, no lawyer\u2014even from the other side, they say often\u2014not always\u2014but when you're under audit, you don't have\u2014you don't subject it to that.

    "Precisely what we ought to do is help resolve the conflict and use our diplomats to convince people there is a better way forward than through violence. We haven't seen violence yet. The idea is to head it off in the first place. I spoke to Vladimir Putin about this very subject when I saw him in the Far East last week. I know that the President has spoken with President Saakashvili as well. The tenor of the conversation appears to be improving to me, that people understand that the best way to resolve their differences is to sit down at the table and solve them diplomatically. And so we'll continue to work along those lines.I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Briefly, just that we sincerely hope that Russia will understand that a democratic state on its borders is not a danger to Russian security. And we hope Russia will understand that authoritarian states at its borders will not guarantee its own stability. That's Deb [Deb Riechmann, Associated Press], AP. Yes, Deb.",
    "Well first of all you know I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.When we have a deal with China\u2014or not\u2014but when we have a deal with China\u2014because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.But when\u2014and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.So I will say though that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.And in the meantime as you know I did tariff relief with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally and we work very well together.But you\u2014your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well. That's true. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing\u2014large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.Please. Thanks. Mr. President Australia is in its 29th year of consecutive economic growth which is an extraordinary national achievement. And we will continue to grow as our most recent national accounts demonstrated.Australia is also very used to dealing with a complex and changing world. And that's why we've diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years. I mean 6 years ago when our government came to office 27 percent of our trade was covered by agreements around the world. That figure is now 70 percent and we're going to take that to 90 percent. And that's important. And that's opening up opportunities.So there are ebbs and flows that go in the global economy and Australia has built up a resilience through the broad-based nature in which we're taking our economy to the world. I mean Australia has never got rich selling things to itself. And we've always had an outward looking perspective when it comes to engaging our economic opportunities.And a big part of what we've been discussing here is some new opportunities whether it's in the rare earth metals the critical minerals the frontier technologies space. You know this is where jobs are going to be in the future as well. And so we will deal with those ebbs and flows as they come.But the President is right: The arrangement they will come to\u2014and I'm confident they will\u2014with China will be one that will set you know a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future with developed economies like Australia. So we look on with interest. And I think ultimately when we arrive at that point it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing. And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it clean coal but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to\u2014because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people. And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day and coal miners are very very safe in Australia. True. It's incredible what you've done. In fact we're looking at what you've done. [] But so\u2014\u2014 We can do a deal on that. So I want to\u2014I want to\u2014we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal.Yes. Go ahead. Please.",

It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well.I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is\u2014you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus.So I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes\u2014doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes.

And what I'm concerned about is, this could get out of hand\u2014very easily get out of hand because of what you said: the borders of the\u2014of Ukraine and what Russia may or may not do.I am hoping that Vladimir Putin understands that he is\u2014short of a full-blown nuclear war, he's not in a very good position to dominate the world.

And that's why we have to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could, in fact, cost his country an awful lot.But I\u2014of course, you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade\u2014this has\u2014if he invades\u2014it hasn't happened since World War II.

    "Let me see if I understood your question properly. First question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty. And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question? I just want to make sure that I'm responsive to your question. I guess I ought to answer on the drones. And Guantanamo, that was a question, I believe, addressed to you. . Okay. Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo. It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there's been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues, I need congressional authorization.But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so. Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade. One war, I think, in Afghanistan, was necessary. One war I disagreed with strongly. But in either case, there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing.The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant, and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don't intend and do not want for the future. I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality.Some of thepeople at Guantanamo are dangerous. Some of them did bad things. But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they're being held even as we're ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these\u2014the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.So I'm confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you're right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked. One of the things you discover as a politician is, is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it.One thing with respect to drone policy: In that speech that I gave, I also addressed that issue of\u2014that, the lethal targeting of identified terrorists. This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly. And as we defeat Al Qaida, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used. I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter\u2014as part of our counterterrorism activities. And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case. That is not. Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here. They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism. If I think of Ramstein, for example\u2014and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder to shoulder here. And we provide bases for our activities, and our work is based also on shared values. As I said, we exchange on\u2014have exchanges on values. But I think it's good. I think it's the right thing to do for the United States of America to be present here with military bases in Germany. It's a normal thing within an alliance, and this is as it should be and as it will be and continue to be.",

    "Good. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.Jackie Calmes [New York Times].",

I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes.. And from my point of view, I believe it is important for us to deliver Brexit. We gave that choice to the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the choice to the British people. We should now deliver on that choice. I continue to believe that, actually, it's in the best interests of the U.K. to leave the European Union in an orderly way with a deal. I think we have a good deal.

    "I love press conferences. It's my press team that's always holding me back. [] I want to talk to you guys every day. [] Sorry, Josh. [] We take the issue of security in large events very seriously. We take the question of security in large-scale events as a very serious issue, which means that we involve all of those bodies or agencies that can and will ensure proper security during the upcoming Olympics. They include the armed forces, the federal police service, and all of the state-level police bodies in the State of Rio de Janeiro.We already have experience in the public security arena because last year we organized and staged the World Soccer Cup, and we did\u2014had to provide security not only to just one city\u2014rather, we had to cover the whole country. And there was not one single action that was left uncontrolled in the 12 different host cities of the World Cup in Brazil, thereby establishing a very effective control system by means of command-and-control centers, as well as monitoring control centers, covering all activities including the displacement of athletes as well as high-ranking government officials and authorities.So we followed up on and ensured proper security conditions to all of those steps. And that is why I am certain that we will be in a position to ensure absolute security during the Olympics, just as was the case during last year's World Soccer Cup.I actually believe that the upcoming 2016 Olympics to be held next June-July in Rio will be a unique and special occasion because it will bring together the joy of the Brazilians and the beauty of Rio. Of course, each country tends to think that they have the world's best city. But I think Rio de Janeiro is indeed the world's best and most beautiful city.So the Olympics will bring together excellent organizational capabilities and also the wonderful ability of Brazilians to welcome and receive visitors and athletes. And all of those who wish to come to Brazil, you have a standing invitation to come to the Olympics because we will certainly ensure not only proper security conditions, but also we will make sure you will be able to enjoy beautiful and great celebration during the upcoming Olympics.Let me now call up our S\u00e3o Paulo Daily Newspaper reporter, Raul Lores, for the second question.",
    "Well, on the second--on your second question, there's no doubt that when someone goes out of their way to be provocative in ways that we know can inflame the passions of over a billion Muslims around the world, at a time when we've got our troops in a lot of Muslim countries, that's a problem. And it has made life a lot more difficult for our men and women in uniform who already have a very difficult job.With respect to the mosque in New York, I think I've been pretty clear on my position here, and that is, is that this country stands for the proposition that all men and women are created equal, that they have certain inalienable rights--one of those inalienable rights is to practice their religion freely. And what that means is that if you could build a church on a site, you could build a synagogue on a site, if you could build a Hindu temple on a site, then you should be able to build a mosque on the site.Now, I recognize the extraordinary sensitivities around 9/11. I've met with families of 9/11 victims in the past. I can only imagine the continuing pain and anguish and sense of loss that they may go through. And tomorrow we as Americans are going to be joining them in prayer and remembrance. But I go back to what I said earlier: We are not at war against Islam. We are at war against terrorist organizations that have distorted Islam or falsely used the banner of Islam to engage in their destructive acts.And we've got to be clear about that. We've got to be clear about that because if we're going to deal with the problems that Ed Henry was talking about, if we're going to successfully reduce the terrorist threat, then we need all the allies we can get. The folks who are most interested in a war between the United States or the West and Islam are Al Qaida. That's what they've been banking on.And fortunately, the overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world are peace loving, are interested in the same things that you and I are interested in: How do I make sure I can get a good job? How can I make sure that my kids get a decent education? How can I make sure I'm safe? How can I improve my lot in life? And so they have rejected this violent ideology for the most part--overwhelmingly.And so from a national security interest, we want to be clear about who the enemy is here. It's a handful, a tiny minority of people who are engaging in horrific acts and have killed Muslims more than anybody else.The other reason it's important for us to remember that is because we've got millions of Muslim Americans, our fellow citizens, in this country. They're going to school with our kids. They're our neighbors. They're our friends. They're our coworkers. And when we start acting as if their religion is somehow offensive, what are we saying to them?I've got Muslims who are fighting in Afghanistan in the uniform of the United States Armed Services. They're out there putting their lives on the line for us. And we've got to make sure that we are crystal clear, for our sakes and their sakes, they are Americans and we honor their service. And part of honoring their service is making sure that they understand that we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us.And that is a principle that I think is going to be very important for us to sustain. And I think tomorrow is an excellent time for us to reflect on that.Thank you very much, everybody.",

And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before. It's true. I mean, it is true. And I heard a little rustle. And I said, It's true. And I heard smiles. And I said, Oh, I didn't know there there'd be that kind . . . They weren't laughing at me. They were laughing with me. We had fun. That was not laughing at me.So the fake news said, People laughed at President Trump. They didn't laugh at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together. We had a good time. They respect what I've done.The United States is respected again. The United States was not respected. Everybody was taking advantage of us, from jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price\u2014to so many other things, even military protection. I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said: Listen, you're a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems.",

    "Well look, symbolically, this is important. I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it's useful to see what's happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently.At the outset, as we're trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that in our meetings over the course of several days, that we'll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field or a farmer that's trying to clear a field or a business that's trying to get set up, that they're not endangered by the possibility of an explosion.Likewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam\u2014to the extent that we're able to find out more about our missing in action and our POWs\u2014that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship.And so a lot of the conversation, I think, will start there, but it doesn't end there. We've had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that's something that we've been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work, I think, would be important. Establishing people-to-people exchanges is another area that historically has been important.I do think Laos, seeing the enormous economic progress that Vietnam and China and others have made, are going to be very interested in finding ways in which they can advance into the global economy and help themselves grow, and I think that we can be a useful partner there.So I think there will be a broad-based agenda. But if you think about the visit I made to Ho Chi Minh City and driving through those streets and the enormous wellspring of good will that you saw, that started with some of the same kinds of steps that we're going to be taking with Laos. But I think we can, hopefully, do it faster, make more progress faster than we did over the course of 10, 15 years, because we've learned some things. And I think Laos is very eager to engage with us, and we're eager to engage with them.So I look forward to visiting what I hear is a beautiful country.

    "First of all, I'd put in perspective the question you asked. Very few schools are closing. Over 95 percent are still open.So you all phrase the questions when people\u2014I don't think it's deliberate on your part, but you phrase the question\u2014if anyone watches this on television\u2014My God, there must be\u2014all those schools must be closing. What are we going to do? Ninety-five percent are still open, number one.Number two, the idea that parents don't think it's important for their children to be in school, and teachers know it as well\u2014that's why we made sure that we had the ability to provide the funding through the Recovery Act\u2014through the act that we\u2014the first act we passed\u2014to be able to make sure schools were able to be safe.So we have new ventilation systems available for them. We have\u2014the way they handle\u2014they scrub down laboratories and\u2014I mean, the lavatories kids go to, to go to the bathroom\u2014cafeterias, buses, et cetera. That\u2014all that money is there. There's billions of dollars made available. That's there.Not every school district has used it as well as it should be used. But it's there. And so, in addition to that, there is now another $10 billion for testing of students in the schools.So I think, as time goes on, it's much more likely you're going to see that number go back up from 95 percent, back up to 98, 99 percent.But the outfit of the individuals of the district that says We're not going to be open is always going to get\u2014and I'm not being critical of any of you\u2014it's always going to get front page. It's always going to be the top of the news.

I went out\u2014I campaigned better smarter harder than Hillary Clinton. I went to Wisconsin. I went to Michigan the night of the vote. I had 32000 people at 1 o'clock in the morning on election day. I won Michigan. I won Wisconsin. I won Pennsylvania. I won States that traditionally haven't been won by a Republican for many years haven't been won by a Republican.And this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that I worked harder and much smarter than Hillary Clinton did.Now I'll say this: Jimmy Carter\u2014I was surprised that he would make a statement. I saw it. It was not a big thing but I saw the statement. And it's\u2014you know a lot of Democrats like to make that statement. He's been trashed within his own party. He's been badly trashed.

    "Well, I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership was not a good deal for us. And if they made it a good deal for us, I'd go in. But honestly, it wasn't. I like bilateral deals much more than multilateral. I like to be able to negotiate with one country. And if it doesn't work out, you terminate. And during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, Please, let's make a deal, and you fix the deal. When you get into multi, you can't do that.But Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014TPP\u2014was a very bad deal for the United States. It would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs. It would have been bad. But there's a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal. I would certainly do that.As far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have Australia involved, and I think Australia wants us to stay involved. I have to say, we've developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time\u2014killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade.But we have developed a great relationship with China\u2014probably closer than we've ever had. And my personal relationship, as Malcolm can tell you, with President Xi is, I think, quite extraordinary. He's somebody that I like, and I think he likes me.

    "Well, look, as you know, Ken, the inflation has everything to do with the supply chain. And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost\u2014of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.The reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.We've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the\u2014in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to\u2014if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of\u2014the total cost of living.Now, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from\u2014including China, India\u2014a number of other countries\u2014to agree with us to go into their version of the\u2014of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that\u2014that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.There's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to\u2014what impact that's going to have on the producers.And so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.But\u2014so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas\u2014natural gas and the like\u2014to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.But I think that we have to deal with\u2014for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are\u2014we've got the Big Four controlling it all.And so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing\u2014buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.Now, and as you\u2014I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.So there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way\u2014the single best way\u2014to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.If you get to trade off higher gas as\u2014you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to\u2014you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade. Their bottom line would be better in middle class households.But it's going to be hard. And it's going to take a lot of work.",
    "When it's under audit\u2014no, nobody would. Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit, okay?",
    "Well, a couple of things. Number one, I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive relationship with Russia. That's been my approach throughout my Presidency. Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. At the beginning of my term, I did what I could to encourage Russia to be a constructive member of the international community and tried to work with the President and the Government of Russia in helping them diversify their economy, improve their economy, use the incredible talents of the Russian people in more constructive ways.I think it's fair to say that after President Putin came back into the Presidency that an escalating anti-American rhetoric and an approach to global affairs that seemed to be premised on the idea that whatever America is trying to do must be bad for Russia and so we want to try and counteract whatever they do, that return to an adversarial spirit that, I think, existed during the cold war has made the relationship more difficult. And it was hammered home when Russia went into Crimea and portions of Ukraine.The reason we imposed the sanctions, recall, was not because of nuclear weapons issues. It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon, by force, by Russia. That wasn't our judgment, that was the judgment of the entire international community. And Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory and meddle in Ukrainian affairs and support military surrogates who have violated basic international law and international norms.What I've said to the Russians is, as soon as you stop doing that, the sanctions will be removed. And I think it would probably best serve not only American interests, but also the interests of preserving international norms if we made sure that we don't confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.On nuclear issues, in my first term, we negotiated the START II Treaty, and that has substantially reduced our nuclear stockpiles, both Russia and the United States. I was prepared to go further. I told President Putin I was prepared to go further. They have been unwilling to negotiate. If President-elect Trump is able to restart those talks in a serious way, I think there is\u2014remains a lot of room for our two countries to reduce our stockpiles. And part of the reason we've been successful on our nonproliferation agenda and on our nuclear security agenda is because we were leading by example.I hope that continues. But I think it's important just to remember that the reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions in Ukraine. And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. They are, historically, bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. But Ukraine is an independent country.And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around the world in preserving basic norms and values, whether it's advocating on behalf of human rights, advocating on behalf of women's rights, advocating on behalf of freedom of the press.The United States has not always been perfect in this regard. There are times where we, by necessity, are dealing with allies or friends or partners who, themselves, are not meeting the standards that we would like to see met when it comes to international rules and norms. But I can tell you that in every multilateral setting\u2014in the United Nations, in the G-20, in the G-7\u2014the United States typically has been on the right side of these issues. And it is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues, because if we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia, and others will not.Kevin Corke [Fox News].",
    "No, Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure it generated some headlines.I think that what we saw in Boston was State, local, Federal officials, every agency rallying around a city that had been attacked, identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined. We now have one individual deceased, one in custody. Charges have been brought.I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place. And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston and all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives.What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know.And the question then is, was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and actualan actual decision by the brother to engage in the attack that wethe tragic attack we actually saw in Boston? And are there thingsadditional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it?Now, what Director Clapper is doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens, we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken. We want to leave no stone unturned. We want to see, is there, in fact, additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack? And we won't know that until that review is completed. We won't know that until the investigation of the actual crime is fully completed. And that's still ongoing.But what I can say is, is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing.But this is hard stuff. And I've said for quite some time that because of the pressure that we've put on Al aida core, because of the pressure that we've put on these networks that are well financed and more sophisticated and can engage in and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States, in some cases, may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack. And those are in some ways more difficult to prevent.And so what I've done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon? Are there more things that we can do, whether it's engaging in communitiesengaging with communities where there's a potential for self-radicalization at thisof this sort? Is there work that can be done in terms of detection? But all of this has to be done in the context of our laws, due process.And so part of what Director Clapper is doing, then, is going to be to see if we can determine any lessons learned from what happened.",
    "Well, I'm tested, and I'm sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting and\u2014like, with Joe. Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don't know, maybe he doesn't want to expose his face.

    "What I said there\u2014I'm surprised that there's any conflict on this. What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. I've worked with them very strongly. There weren't seventeen as was previously reported; there were actually four. But they were saying there was seventeen; there were actually four. But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.Now, at the same time, I want to be able\u2014because I think it's very important\u2014to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve. And frankly, Russia and China in particular can help us with the problem, which is one of our truly great problems.So I'm not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there's reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation. I think it was very obvious to everybody. I believe that President Putin really feels\u2014and he feels strongly\u2014that he did not meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes.What I believe is that we have to get to work. And I think everybody understood this that heard the answer. We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve , to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism.And, you know, people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned. They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken. Those are very important things. And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability.And by the way, Hillary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled reset wrong. That's how it started, and then it got worse. President Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn't there. Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing, believe me. It's a good thing, not a bad thing.Okay, second.",
    "I think that's probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race because she got her facts wrong. You know she's very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts.And just so you understand: We've done more testing than any country in the world by far. That includes India which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: Where do we get it? How do we get it? We have better testing than any country in the world.When you do as much testing as us however as you understand you develop more cases. If you tested instead of 65 million people which is what we've done\u2014when you test that many people\u2014you're going to find cases that normally you wouldn't see.If you go to Mexico and you go to other countries you'll see they do almost no testing. They test if somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic. They test very little. They test very little.We've done more testing than anybody in the world.

    "Well, I'll let you guys engage in those comparisons, and you can go ahead and read the history, I think, and draw your own conclusions.My concern is making sure that if there's a problem in the Government, that we fix it. That's my responsibility, and that's what we're going to do. That's true with respect to the IRS and making sure that they apply the laws the way they were intended. That's true with respect to the security of our diplomats, which is why we're going to need to work with Congress to make sure that there's adequate funding for what's necessary out there.Now, with respect to the Department of Justice, I'm not going to comment on a specific and pending case. But I can talk broadly about the balance that we have to strike. Leaks related to national security can put people at risk. They can put men and women in uniform that I've sent into the battlefield at risk. They can put some of our intelligence officers, who are in various, dangerous situations that are easily compromised, at risk.U.S. national security is dependent on those folks being able to operate with confidence that folks back home have their backs so they're not just left out there high and dry and potentially put in even more danger than they may already be. And so I make no apologies, and I don't think the American people would expect me as Commander in Chief not to be concerned about information that might compromise their missions or might get them killed.Now, the flip side of it is, we also live in a democracy where a free press, free expression, and the open flow of information helps hold me accountable, helps hold our Government accountable, and helps our democracy function. And the whole reason I got involved in politics is because I believe so deeply in that democracy and that process.So the whole goal of this media shield law\u2014that was worked on and largely endorsed by folks like the Washington Post editorial page and by prosecutors\u2014was finding a way to strike that balance appropriately. And to the extent that this case\u2014which we still don't know all the details of\u2014to the extent that this case has prompted renewed interest about how do we strike that balance properly, then I think now is the time for us to go ahead and revisit that legislation. I think that's a worthy conversation to have, and I think that's important.But I also think it's important to recognize that when we express concern about leaks at a time when I've still got 60,000-plus troops in Afghanistan and I've still got a whole bunch of intelligence officers around the world who are in risky situations\u2014in outposts that, in some cases, are as dangerous as the outpost in Benghazi\u2014that part of my job is to make sure that we're protecting what they do, while still accommodating for the need for information, so\u2014or the need for the public to be informed and be able to hold my office accountable.",

    "Well, a number of things. First of all, Black unemployment is almost cut in half under my administration just since I began. More Black businesses have opened up\u2014small businesses\u2014than ever before.We're now in a situation where we're providing, through the Small Business Administration, downpayments for people buying homes, because most people accumulate wealth in the value of their home, most middle class families like mine.

We brought\u2014we've already brought down the price of gasoline about $1.20 a gallon across the board. And I think that the oil companies are really doing the Nation a real disservice. They've made\u2014six of them made over $100 billion in the last quarter in profit. A hundred billion dollars.In the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before\u2014one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that\u2014you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to sell\u2014than they are selling it now, not taking advantage. And that lowers the price of the total gallon of gas because that gets passed on.So there's a whole lot of things that we can do that are difficult to do, but we're going to continue to push to do them.And the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and the average Black community. One, prescription drug costs. Well, we're driving those down precipitously, beginning next year.And you know, I'll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we're going to reduce that cost. They're not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of four\u2014average of $400.And I can go down the list of the things that\u2014my dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for, from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it's done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community and the poor\u2014and poorer communities. They need help.And so we're driving down all of those costs. And we've already passed the legislation to do that; it's just taking effect. So there's a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.And so\u2014but I am optimistic, because we continue to grow and at a rational pace, we're not anywhere near a recession right now, in terms of the growth. But I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing. I'm convinced that we're going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they, in fact, end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.",
    "I do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world\u2014especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.And we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.I viewed it two ways. Number one, military\u2014because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right. And I feel that, look, you look at the history of Poland and Russia, that's a long and very complicated history. So he certainly has a right to feel that way. Okay?",
    "Okay. Well, first of all, I want to congratulate the Senate on moving forward on providing me the authority to not only strike a smart, progressive, growth-promoting trade deal with some of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in Europe as well, but also to give me the tools to enforce those agreements, which haven't always happened in the past.So I want to thank all the Senators who voted to provide that authority, or at least to begin the debate on moving that process forward. Those who didn't vote for it, I want to keep on trying to make the case and provide them the information they need to feel confident that despite the fact that there have been very genuine problems with some trade deals in the past, the approach that we're taking here, I think, is the right one, not just for big U.S. businesses, but also for small U.S. businesses and medium-sized U.S. businesses and, most importantly, ultimately, American workers. I would not be promoting any agreement that I didn't think, at the end of the day, was going to be creating jobs in the United States and giving us more of an opportunity to create ladders of success, higher incomes, and higher wages for the American people, because that's my primary focus. It has been since I came into office.The issue with respect to myself and Elizabeth has never been personal. I mean, I think it's fun for the press to see if we can poke around at it when you see two close allies who have a disagreement on a policy issue. But there are a whole bunch of\u2014some of my best friends in the Senate, as well in the House, some of my earliest supporters who disagree with me on this. And I understand. Because, like me, they came up through the ranks watching plants close, jobs being shipped overseas. Like me, they have concerns about whether labor agreements or environmental agreements with other countries are properly enforced. Like me, they have concerns about whether in fact trade ends up being fair and not just free.And, like me, they have a deep concern about some of the global trends that we've seen and trends that we've seen in our own country in terms of increased inequality and what appears to be the effects of automation and globalization in allowing folks at the very top to do really, really well, but creating stagnation in terms of incomes and wages for middle class families and folks working to get their way into the middle class.So these are folks whose values are completely aligned with mine. I noticed that there was sort of a progressive statement of principles about what it means to be a progressive by some of these friends of mine, and I noted that it was basically my agenda, except for trade. [] Right? That was the one area where there was a significant difference. And this just comes down to a policy difference and an analysis in terms of what we think is best for our people, our constituents.It is my firm belief that, despite the problems of previous trade deals, that we are better off writing high-standard rules with strong, enforceable provisions on things like child labor or deforestation or environmental degradation or wildlife trafficking or intellectual property; we are better off writing those rules for what is going to be the largest, fastest growing market in the world. And if we don't, China will, and other countries will. And our businesses will be disadvantaged, and our workers will ultimately suffer.And in terms of some of the fears of outsourcing of jobs, it is my belief, based on the analysis, that at this point, if there was a company in the United States that was looking for low-cost labor, they have no problem outsourcing it under the current regime. And so what we do have the opportunity to do is to attract back companies to manufacture here in the United States.And we're seeing some of that happen. That's why I went out to Nike. I understand that Nike has been manufacturing shoes with low-cost labor in many of these areas in the Asia-Pacific region and that hurt the American footwear industry in terms of jobs here in the United States. But that happened over the course of the last 30 years. And now, for Nike to announce that because of new technologies, they're potentially bringing 10,000 jobs back here because we've gone up the value chain, we're manufacturing in different ways, that's an opportunity. But we've still got to be able to sell over there to take full advantage of those opportunities.Which is why my argument with my progressive friends is, what we really need to be focusing on to meet the same objectives\u2014the shared objectives\u2014is the kinds of other issues that we all agree on: strong minimum wage, strong job training programs, infrastructure investments that put people back to work, stronger laws to protect collective bargaining and the capability of workers to have a voice, strong enforcement of rules around things like overtime pay, making sure that we have paid sick leave, making sure that we have a honest conversation about our budgets and that we're not slashing investments in the future simply to make sure that we're preserving loopholes for corporations that don't provide any economic benefit.Those are the things that are going to help us address the very problems that they're concerned about. Blocking a trade deal will not, particularly since they're the first ones to acknowledge that the existing trade rules are a bad deal for U.S. workers. If they're not working for us now, how does hanging on to what's going on now help American workers? It doesn't make sense.I'm all for enforcement and the provisions that were signed. I have expressed concerns about how the currency language that is in the bill is drafted. But I have to talk to Senator Schumer and Sherrod Brown and others about how we can work on language that does not end up having a blowback effect on our ability to maintain our own monetary policy.I don't even remember what your other question was. []",
    "Let me see if I understood your question properly. First question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty. And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question? I just want to make sure that I'm responsive to your question. I guess I ought to answer on the drones. And Guantanamo, that was a question, I believe, addressed to you. . Okay. Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo. It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there's been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues, I need congressional authorization.But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so. Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade. One war, I think, in Afghanistan, was necessary. One war I disagreed with strongly. But in either case, there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing.The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant, and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don't intend and do not want for the future. I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality.Some of thepeople at Guantanamo are dangerous. Some of them did bad things. But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they're being held even as we're ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these\u2014the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.So I'm confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you're right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked. One of the things you discover as a politician is, is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it.One thing with respect to drone policy: In that speech that I gave, I also addressed that issue of\u2014that, the lethal targeting of identified terrorists. This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly. And as we defeat Al Qaida, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used. I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter\u2014as part of our counterterrorism activities. And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case. That is not. Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here. They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism. If I think of Ramstein, for example\u2014and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder to shoulder here. And we provide bases for our activities, and our work is based also on shared values. As I said, we exchange on\u2014have exchanges on values. But I think it's good. I think it's the right thing to do for the United States of America to be present here with military bases in Germany. It's a normal thing within an alliance, and this is as it should be and as it will be and continue to be.",
    "I am confident that we've got a team in place that can execute. Now, I'm paying very close attention to make sure that they execute, and I will be insisting on extraordinary performance moving forward.One last thing I just want to remind everybody, though, that the issues with General McChrystal that culminated in my decision yesterday were not as a result of a difference in policy. I want to be very clear about that. He was executing the policy that I had laid out; that he was executing the orders that I had issued and that were reflective of the review process that took place last year. Okay? I'll try to be even briefer than my colleague, Mr. President. You know, I hope that we have quite friendly relations with President Obama, but I try not to give pieces of advice that cannot be fulfilled. This is a hard topic, a difficult one. I can say only two things. First of all, we believe that, at present, the United States and some other countries are assisting the Afghan people in obtaining the much wanted statehood and restore the basis of the functioning of an effective state, restore their civil society and their economy. And in these terms, we will support and back the efforts of the U.S.As far as our own experience, well-known experiences--[inaudible]--I would very much like to see the Afghan people in near future having an effective state and a modern economy, which requires toiling more than a year. But this is the path to guarantee that the most--the gravest scenarios of the last time will not repeat.Please, ITAR-TASS.",
    "Good. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.Jackie Calmes [New York Times].",

I would, in fact, put it in terms of how much interest does he have in burnishing 's reputation that is not\u2014is viewed as not being contrary to democratic principles and free speech.That's a judgment I cannot make. I don't know. But it's not because I think he is interested in changing the nature of a closed society or closed government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach.And you know, there's a couple of really good biographies\u2014I told him I read a couple\u2014I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well.And I think I pointed out to him that had an opportunity\u2014that brief shining moment after Gorbachev and after things began to change drastically\u2014to actually generate a democratic government. But what happened was, it failed and there was a great, great race among n intellectuals to determine what form of government would they choose and how would they choose it.And based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided was that has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a n state, not based on ideology\u2014whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution\u2014the n Revolution, and to where they are today.And I think that it's clear to me\u2014and I've said it\u2014that I think he decided that the way for to be able to sustain itself as a great\u2014quote, great power is to in fact unite the n people on just the strength of the government\u2014the government controls\u2014not necessarily ideologically, but the government.And I think that's the choice that was made.

    "A couple of things\u2014first of all, I respect those Republicans that you're referring to. I presume you're referring to friends of mine, like Lugar\u2014or Senator Lugar, Domenici, yes. These are good, honorable people. I've spoken to them, and I listen very carefully to what they have to say.First of all, they share my concern that a precipitous withdrawal would embolden Al Qaida. And they also understand that we can't let Al Qaida gain safe haven inside of Iraq. I appreciate their calls, and I appreciate their desire to work with the White House to be in a position where we can sustain a presence in Iraq.What I tell them is this\u2014just what I've told you\u2014is that as the Commander in Chief of the greatest military ever, I have an obligation, a sincere and serious obligation, to hear out my commander on the ground. And I will take his recommendation and\u2014as I mentioned\u2014to talk to Bob Gates about it, as well as the Joint Chiefs about it, as well as consult with Members of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, as I make a decision about the way forward in Iraq.And so I\u2014you know, I value the advice of those Senators. I appreciate their concerns about the situation in Iraq, and I am going to continue listening to them.Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters].",
    "I don't know much about Medvedev either. And what will be interesting to see is who comes to the\u2014who represents Russia at the G-8, for example. It will be interesting to see\u2014it will help, I think, give some insight as to how Russia intends to conduct foreign policy over\u2014 after Vladimir Putin's Presidency. And I can't answer the question yet.I can say that it's in our interests to continue to have relations with Russia. For example, on proliferation matters, it's in our interest to be able to make sure that materials that could cause great harm aren't proliferated. It's in our interest to work together on Iran. As I said, I think, in this room the last time I was here, I appreciated the fact that Vladimir Putin told the Iranians that they will provide\u2014they, Russia\u2014will provide enriched uranium to run the Bushehr power plant, thereby negating the need for the Iranians to enrich in the first place. I thought that was a constructive suggestion. And we need to be in a position to be able to work with Russia on Iran.There's a lot of areas where\u2014yesterday, for example, with the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, I talked about a missile defense system in Europe. But I believe it's in our interests to try to figure out a way for the Russians to understand the system is not aimed at them but aimed at the real threats of the 21st century, which could be a launch from a violent regime\u2014a launch of a weapon of mass destruction.So there's areas, David [David Gregory, NBC News], where we need to cooperate and\u2014let me finish\u2014and so it's a\u2014I'm going to try to leave it so whoever my successor is will be able to have a relationship with whoever is running foreign policy in Russia. It's just\u2014it's in the country's interest. That doesn't mean we have to agree all the time. I mean, obviously, we didn't agree on Kosovo. There will be other areas where we don't agree.

But I will remind you, there is no credible evidence that there has been any wrongdoing.",
    "I'm not going to comment on the matter. Would you like another question?",
    "David, I believe Iraq had a lot to do with the election, but I believe there was other factors as well. People want their Congressmen to be honest and ethical. So in some races, that was the primary factor. There were different factors that determined the outcome of different races, but no question, Iraq was on people's minds. And as you have just learned, I am making a change at the Secretary of Defense to bring a fresh perspective as to how to achieve something I think most Americans want, which is a victory.We will work with Members of Congress; we will work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. My point is, is that while we have been adjusting, we will continue to adjust to achieve the objective. And I believe that's what the American people want.Somehow it seeped in their conscious that my attitude was just simply, stay the course. Stay the course means, let's get the job done, but it doesn't mean staying stuck on a strategy or tactics that may not be working. So perhaps I need to do a better job of explaining that we're constantly adjusting. And so there's fresh perspective\u2014so what the American people hear today is, we're constantly looking for fresh perspective.But what's also important for the American people to understand is that if we were to leave before the job is done, the country becomes more at risk. That's what the Vice President was saying. He said, If the job is not complete, Al Qaida will have safe haven from which to launch attacks. These radicals and extremists have made it clear they want to topple moderate governments to spread their ideology. They believe that it's just a matter of time before we leave so they can implement their strategies. We're just not going to let them do that. We're going to help this Government become a government that can defend, govern, and sustain itself and an ally in the war on terror.Yes, sir.",
    "Would you like to ask another question?",
    "Well, we will start with your second part of the question. And I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with . I started a process, and when I did, everybody thought I was doing it absolutely wrong. But in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing, and nothing happened. And a lot is happening right now. I can tell you that, Jeff. A lot is happening. And I think it's going to be very positive. And I hope it's going to be very positive for and for South Korea and Japan and the rest of the world.But I am starting at a level that, frankly, I shouldn't have had to start. This should have been worked out a long time ago. This should have been worked out many years ago. We were discussing that. We shouldn't be having this situation happen to the United States and the world. This should have been resolved by other Presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago.With that being said, I think we're doing very well. Meetings are being set up. And I want to see denuclearization of . A lot of concessions have already been made. We have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that I've made concessions. I don't\u2014I haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing. And I'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having.I will say this: We put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far. China, President Xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem, in his case, at the border. He's allowing very little to get through.I think he's doing that for a number of reasons. We have a very good relationship, and also, it's very important in terms of trade, because I do play the trade card. If you look at what's happening with trade in China, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the United States, and we're going to solve that problem. In fact, we're having Secretary Mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to\u2014Bob Lighthizer\u2014heading over to China, at the request of China. They came here, as you know, last week. And we're having very substantive discussions on trade.But I think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people. And I believe the trade will work out, but I also think that China has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that I'm President. I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi. And I think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with .So the end result is, we'll see. Maybe good things will happen, and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time. But hopefully, it will be good for everybody concerned.As far as Syria is concerned, I would love to get out. I'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home. They've done a great job. We've essentially just absolutely obliterated ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. And we've done a big favor to neighboring countries, frankly, but we've also done a favor for our country.With that being said, Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don't want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it. To a large extent, we really have controlled it, and we've set control on it. So we'll see what happens.But we're going to be coming home relatively soon. We finished, at least, almost our work with respect to ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do.But with that being said, I do want to come home. But I want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish. So we are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal. When they made the Iran deal, what they should have done is included Syria. When I say should have\u2014before giving them, Iran, $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014$1.8 million in cash. If you think about this, before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay\u2014$150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014in barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out\u2014cash\u2014they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is involved\u2014where Iran is involved. They didn't do that.So we want to come home. We'll be coming home. But we want to have a very, very strong\u2014we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint, and that was a very big part of our discussion. Okay? Thank you.",
    "So we talked about many things\u2014many, many things. We talked about Iran. We talked about Iraq. We talked about\u2014you know, we were together for 2 days. I'm going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7 o'clock. It starts at 7, I believe.And we talked about exactly all of the things that you're talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders. And I said, we have to stop that. We have to stop it, at least as it pertains to the United States. And I think we're understanding each other.With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent on $250 billion.But in the meantime, we're working with China very much on the virus. We feel that's something. And I have to tell\u2014I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is\u2014he is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he's going to do well.Now you see it's going to South Korea, it's going to Italy, and it's going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They're all working very, very hard on it.The United States, because of an early decision I made\u2014I made a decision. I believe it was the first time it's ever been done: We closed the country to certain areas, as you know. And I was criticized for that decision. Now they're saying it was a good decision.I think it was a good decision, because we have very few people. And you can add to it a few people that we took in because they're Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in between countries, where people weren't going to take them, and they're Americans. But they're fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. So you know, we did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country\u2014these were wonderful people. It wasn't their fault.So\u2014but we're down to\u2014we're really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we've had a very strict line on the people that were taken\u2014the areas from which we take. And I did it very early. It's never done before, and I did it early.

    "Well, first of all, let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.It has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional\u2014disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of Government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place.I recognize that there's some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or Embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind.So with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.What I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.And we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure our\u2014the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their Government is doing on their behalf.But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.Margaret Brennan [CBS News].",
    "On immigration reform, I've been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is: We've got to have more effective border security, although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last 4 to 5 years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we've got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country.And the Senate bill meets thatthose criteria, in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it's a it's a testament to the Senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill.Now, I haven't seen what Members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better. And I think we've got to be open minded in seeing what they come up with. The bottom line, though, is, is that they've still got to meet those basic criteria: Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the governments to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country?And if they meet those criteria, but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.When it comes to Mexico, I'm very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Pe\u00f1a Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations, and it will be an opportunity for his Ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating, to really hammer out some of these issues.A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We've spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes, I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time.That doesn't mean that we're not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two Governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.And some of the issues that he's talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se. So I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.But overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform. He's already made some tough decisions. I think he's going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well.And I don't want to leave out that we're also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us, because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence.There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip. And I'm sure that those of you who will have the chance to travel with me, we'll have a chance to discuss this further.All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, guys.",
    "These things are a tough process. And look, in fairness, a big deal would require a lot of work on the part of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and myself to bring Democrats along.

We had a great time\u2014a great time\u2014in Cleveland.But it's a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was, and I think we'll have that, including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive.I have to say, the stock market is close to records.

    "I support a plan that says that there will be an independent judiciary analyzing every charge brought forth, and when someone is found guilty, there's punishment. That's the kind of plan I support. It happens to be the kind of plan the President supports. In other words, there's no political favorites when it comes to justice, that if someone is guilty, they will pay a penalty. And the best way to assure that that penalty is fair and the justice is fair is for there to be a court independent from politics.And so when I asked this very same question to the President about the news I've been reading in Washington, DC, the same questions he's going to be asked when he and his government come to talk to our Congress, he answered just like I described. He said: We have an independent court. We've got a firm law. People will be held to account, whether or not they're\u2014no matter what political party they may or may not be associated with. That's what the people of Colombia expect; that's the kind of justice they're going to receive.Listen, this country has come through some very difficult times.

    "has been resisting, and they've reacted aggressively to the new U.N. Security Council resolution, which is quite expected. And of course, the ns may react by firing another round of missiles or taking actions. We can also expect that from them as well. However, ns must understand that they will not be able to gain compensation by provoking a crisis. This has been a pattern in the past, but this will no longer be. The firm U.S.-Korea cooperation and alliance will not allow that. And the recent Security Council resolution is not simply about words; it is about taking follow-up action and vigorously implementing the U.N. Security Council resolution. And we'll make sure that we fully implement the U.N. Security Council resolution.Like I said, the ns must understand that their past behavior will not stand. And of course, not only the U.S.-Korea close partnership, but Japan, China, and the rest of the international community will take part in this effort. And now the ns will come to understand that this is different, that they will not be able to repeat the past or their past tactics and strategies. I urge the ns to fully give up their nuclear weapons programs and ambitions and to become a responsible member of the international community.With regards to the Kaesong industrial complex, the n authorities are demanding unacceptable demands, and we will not accept such demands being laid out by the ns. Of course, the South Korean Government is very much for maintaining the Kaesong industrial complex because the Kaesong industrial complex is a channel of dialog between the two Koreas. And also, another fact that we must not overlook is the fact that there are 40,000 n workers currently working in Kaesong industrial complex. If the Kaesong industrial complex were to close, these 40,000 n workers will lose their jobs.And therefore, I ask that--I urge the ns not to make any unacceptable demands, because we cannot really know what will happen if they continue on this path. And also the ns have been detaining a South Korean worker. They haven't been giving us any explanation, and also we know that there are two American journalists being currently held by the ns. I urge the ns to release not only the two American journalists, but also the South Korean worker, without any conditions, to release them as soon as possible. The international community is asking the ns to take that path. And once again, I urge in the strongest terms that they release these two American journalists, as well as the Korean worker being held.United Nations Sanctions Against Chip [Chip Reid, CBS News].",
    "Well, first of all, I'm not going to comment at this point on various nominations that I'll put forward to fill out my Cabinet for the second term. Those are things that are still being discussed.But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace.As I've said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her. If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. Ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.And we're after an election now. I think it is important for us to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi, and I'm happy to cooperate in any ways that Congress wants. We have provided every bit of information that we have, and we will continue to provide information. And we've got a full-blown investigation, and all that information will be disgorged to Congress.And I don't think there's any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem. And we've got to get to the bottom of it, and there needs to be accountability. We've got to bring those who carried it out to justice. They won't get any debate from me on that.But when they go after the U.N. Ambassador, apparently, because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me. And should I choose, if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity of the State Department, then I will nominate her. That's not a determination that I've made yet.

    "No two countries are identical And obviously, there's a difference between a referendum on a very complex relationship between Great Britain and the rest of Europe and a Presidential election in the United States Presidential elections always turn on personalities They turn on how campaigns are run They turn on natural desires for change If you've had an incumbent who has been there for 8 years, there's a temptation to think, well, let's maybe make a change I think there are a whole range of factors involvedBut I do think that there is a common theme that we've seen in a lot of advanced economies and that we've seen around the world, although they manifest themselves in different ways Globalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people's lives, sometimes in very concrete ways\u2014a manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly, an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment\u2014but also psychologically People are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world It starts looking different and disorienting And there is no doubt that that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right, in many countries in Europe When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders\u2014very unconventional candidates\u2014have considerable success, then obviously, there's something there that's being tapped intoA suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses, a suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity And that can be a volatile mixIt's important to recognize, though, that those trends have always been there And it's the job, I think, of leaders to try to address people's real, legitimate concerns and channel them in the most constructive ways possibleDid I recognize that there was anger or frustration in the American population? Of course, I did First of all, we had to fight back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and I can guarantee you, if your housing values have crashed and you've lost your\u2014most of your pension and you've lost your job, you're going to be pretty angry And so we bought\u2014fought back and recovered But that left, I think, fear and anxiety in a lot of people, a sense that the economy wasn't as certain as it could be, and maybe the game was rigged on Wall Street or by special interests in Washington or what have you And that's been thereI was also aware of it because of the fact that you have seen some of the rhetoric among Republican and elected officials and activists and media\u2014some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people And obviously, President-elect Trump tapped into that particular strain within the Republican Party and then was able to broaden that enough and get enough votes to win the electionThe lesson I draw\u2014and I think people can draw a lot of lessons, but maybe one that cuts across countries\u2014is, we have to deal with issues like inequality We have to deal with issues of economic dislocation We have to deal with people's fears that their children won't do as well as they have The more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that pit people against each otherAnd frankly, that was\u2014that's been my agenda for the last 8 years I think raising wages, investing in infrastructure, making sure that people have access to good educations that are\u2014equip them for the jobs of the future\u2014those are all agenda items that would help alleviate some of those economic pressures and dislocations that people are experiencing The problem was, I couldn't convince the Republican Congress to pass a lot of themNow, having said that, people seem to think I did a really\u2014pretty good job And so there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger Perhaps the view of the American people was, is that we just need to shake things up Time will now tell whether the prescriptions that are being offered\u2014whether Brexit or with respect to the US election\u2014ends up actually satisfying those people who have been fearful or angry or concerned And I think that's going to be an interesting test, because I think I can make a pretty strong argument that the policies we put forward were the right ones; that we've grown faster than just about any advanced economy The country is indisputably better off, and those folks who voted for the President-elect are better off than they were when I came into office, for the most part But we'll see whether those facts affect people's calculations in the next electionPrime Minister Tsipras You asked if I believe that Angela Merkel could be convinced to make on\u2014but which are the necessary steps for the recovery of the Greek economy Well, my answer is I'm very optimistic, and this for two reasons Number one, Angela Merkel is a German politician, and Germans sometimes insist\u2014sometimes they are disagreeable, but they insist\u2014that the agreements must be honoredAnd what is expected to happen with Greece is that which was agreed last July, August, in the summer of 2015, that was as soon as Greece shows that it has decided to proceed with the courageous and difficult reforms, that when the first and most difficult review is completed, then decisions will be taken, measures will be implemented to reduce\u2014to provide debt relief to Greece so that Greece can go out into the money markets and for growth to return at a very high rate in the Greek economySo the first reason for my optimism is that just as the German Finance Minister used to say, This is a Latin expression, which we sometimes use, where\u2014although we have learned not Latin, but Ancient Greek in our schoolsThe second reason for which I'm optimistic is that I have met Angela Merkel to\u2014in person; so has Barack Obama We worked very close together during the period of the huge refugee crisis Our cooperation is very good, and therefore, I'm of the opinion that she is a responsible politician, a politician who has a sense of responsibility for Europe and not only for Germany or for the\u2014her political party And this was the manner in which she dealt with the refugee crisis: with a deep sense of responsibility on the future of Europe and on stabilityAnd for these two important reasons, I do expect that she will be convinced that these two necessary steps must be made\u2014two steps that will not be a burden to German taxpayers\u2014so that Greece can become not a member\u2014a part of the problem, but a part of the solution for security, for growth, and for resolving the refugee issue, for which Greece plays an important roleAnd that is why I'm optimistic, and I expect my optimism to be realized",
    "Not only have I run my last election, but I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections. That is your job. [] And there's no shortage of people who are happy to opine on that. I will not be one of them.On Cuba, we are not in the business of regime change. We are in the business of making sure the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to participate and shape their own destiny and their own lives and supporting civil society.And there's going to be an evolution, regardless of what we do, inside of Cuba. Partly, it's going to be generational. If you listened to President Castro's comments earlier this morning, a lot of the points he made referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message here is, the cold war is over. There's still a whole lot of challenges that we face and a lot of issues around the world, and we're still going to have serious issues with Cuba on not just the Cuban Government's approach to its own people, but also regional issues and concerns. There are going to be areas where we cooperate as well. Cuban doctors deployed during the Ebola crisis made a difference; Cuban activity in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake made a difference. And so there may be areas of collaboration as well.What I said to President Castro is the same thing that I've said to leaders throughout the region: We have a point of view, and we won't be shy about expressing it. But I'm confident that the way to lift up the values that we care about is through persuasion. And that's going to be the primary approach that we take on a whole host of these issues, primarily because they don't implicate our national security in a direct way.And I think that we have to be very clear: Cuba is not a threat to the United States. That doesn't mean we don't have differences with it. But on the list of threats that I'm concerned about, I think it's fair to say that between ISIL and Iran getting a nuclear weapon and activities in Yemen and Libya and Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine and our\u2014the impact on our allies there\u2014I could go down a pretty long list\u2014climate change. [] So our\u2014I think our approach has to be one of trying to work with the region and other countries and be very clear about what we believe and what we stand for and what we think works and what doesn't.And so often, when we insert ourselves in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive. It backfires. That's been part of our history, and\u2014which is why countries keep on trying to use us as an excuse for their own governance failures. Let's take away the excuse. And let's be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everybody to try to lift up opportunity and prosperity and security for people in the region.Major Garrett [CBS News].",

    "All right, Mike, you've asked a couple of questions there, so let me--let's start with the Iran situation since that's been the topic in the news for the last few days.When I came into office, Iran was unified, on the move, had made substantial progress on its nuclear program, and the world was divided in terms of how to deal with it. What we've been able to do over the last 3 years is mobilize unprecedented, crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran is feeling the bite of these sanctions in a substantial way. The world is unified; Iran is politically isolated.And what I have said is, is that we will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon. My policy is not containment; my policy is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, because if they get a nuclear weapon, that could trigger an arms race in the region, it would undermine our nonproliferation goals, it could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists. And we've been in close consultation with all our allies, including Israel, in moving this strategy forward.At this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity where this can still be resolved diplomatically. That's not just my view. That's the view of our top intelligence officials; It's the view of top Israeli intelligence officials. And as a consequence, we are going to continue to apply the pressure even as we provide a door for the Iranian regime to walk through where they could rejoin the community of nations by giving assurances to the international community that they're meeting their obligations and they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.That's my track record. Now, what's said on the campaign trail, those folks don't have a lot of responsibilities. They're not Commander in Chief. And when I see the casualness with which some of these folks talk about war, I'm reminded of the costs involved in war. I'm reminded that the decision that I have to make in terms of sending our young men and women into battle and the impacts that has on their lives, the impact it has on our national security, the impact it has on our economy.This is not a game, and there's nothing casual about it. And when I see some of these folks who have a lot of bluster and a lot of big talk, but when you actually ask them specifically what they would do, it turns out they repeat the things that we've been doing over the last 3 years, it indicates to me that that's more about politics than actually trying to solve a difficult problem.Now, the one thing that we have not done is we haven't launched a war. If some of these folks think that it's time to launch a war, they should say so. And they should explain to the American people exactly why they would do that and what the consequences would be. Everything else is just talk.",
    "I think has been a big help, bigger than most people know. On the border, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come through . So there's a great power there. At the same time, I believe\u2014I happen to believe that North Korea is calling its own shots. They're not taking orders from anybody. He's a very strong guy. And they're able to do things that are pretty amazing. But 93 percent still come in from . has an influence, and has been a big help.And Russia has been a big help too. As you know, there's a pretty small part of the border, but nevertheless significant, about 28 miles. And things can happen there too. And they've been a help.Yes, go ahead, please.",
    "I do agree that we're not going to solve the problems in Syria unless there's buy-in from the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks, our Gulf partners. It's too chaotic. There are too many factions. There's too much money and too many arms flooding into the zone. It's gotten caught up in both sectarian conflict and geopolitical jockeying. And in order for us to resolve it, there's going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield. So Iran is one of those players, and I think that it's important for them to be part of that conversation.I want to repeat what I said earlier. We have not\u2014and I don't anticipate any time in the near future\u2014restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran. And so I do not foresee a formal set of agreements with Iran in terms of how we're conducting our counter-ISIL campaign.But clearly, Iran has influence in Iraq. Iraq has a majority Shia population. They have relationships to Iran. Some are natural. We expect somebody like Prime Minister Abadi to meet with and negotiate and work with Iran as its neighbor. Some are less legitimate, where you see Iran financing Shia militias that, in the past, have killed American soldiers and, in the future, may carry out atrocities when they move into Sunni areas.And so we're working with our diplomats on the ground, as well as our military teams on the ground to asses where can we appropriately at least deconflict and where can we work with Prime Minister Abadi around an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty and where do we tell Abadi, you know what, what Iran is doing there is a problem, and we can't cooperate in that area, for example, unless you get those folks out of there because we're not going to have our troops, even in an advisory or training role, looking over their shoulders because they're not sure what might happen to them. And those conversations have been ongoing. I think they will continue.The one thing you can count on is that any work that the U.S. Government does or the U.S. military does in Iraq with other partners on the ground is premised on the idea that they are reporting to\u2014under the chain of command of the Iraqi Government and Iraqi security forces. If we don't have confidence that ultimately Abadi is directing those soldiers, then it's tough for us to have any kind of direct relationship. Okay?Major Garrett [CBS News].",

But I did speak with the pastor of the family, who is a fine man, a wonderful man. And I think we had a great talk.And I may, at some point, you know, do that.

    "First of all, your President was very articulate on the subject of visas. One of the benefits of having a good friendship is that he's not afraid of telling me what's on his mind. [] And he made it abundantly clear that visa policy in America must take into account Romanian past and also Romanian future and present. In other words\u2014and I fully understand the frustrations of the Romanian people. I understand it. I understand that a citizen says: Wait a minute. We're contributing soldiers in Iraq, and yet we're not necessarily treated like other nations in the European collective or European Union.And those frustrations are clearly understandable. That's why I went to Congress and tried to get them to modernize the visa law. And all they\u2014although they changed the law, it still creates certain hurdles for nations like Romania. And I assured the President that we will work with him as best as we can to adhere to our law and to, at the same time, understands the contradictions.It's\u2014hopefully, the new law will\u2014and our cooperation\u2014will make it easier for Romanian citizens to come and visit their relatives. And obviously, to the extent that somebody tries to come and not come back is something we all got to guard about. That's\u2014but the idea of somebody coming to visit a relative or a long-lost cousin to say hello and to see what America is like and then come back to Romania is an issue that we just got to be thoughtful about.And so yes, I mean, this is\u2014this subject came up. It is clear there's a level of frustration. I explained our new law is in effect, and we'll work closely with the Romanian Government to meet our law and, at the same time, meet the demands of a strong and good ally.Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Right, you want to go over here? Just a moment. Oh, you got\u2014\u2014 Just a moment. He's not through. The information would like to add to refer to two delicate issues, issues that are visible for the Romanian public.

And we hope to find, in time, the decision taken by President Bush was that, in the near future, we will launch the bilateral mechanism that\u2014apart from the European ones.

We shouldn't be in this position. We shouldn't be in this position on tariffs, where we're hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that, frankly, were never even negotiated with.

They were missing in action, our leaders.Well, a very similar thing, if you think about it, took place with . This should not be done now.

    "On Sochi, I don't know, but the chances are\u2014advancing my logic is good, since I'll be there talking about it. And we'll see whether or not there's an agreement. But obviously, we've got work to do to convince the President and people around him that the missile defense system is not aimed at Russia. In other words, it's viewed as an anti-Russian device. Well, it's not, and therefore, it requires a lot of time, a lot of discussion. That's what Condi Rice and Bob Gates spent time doing when they were there in Russia, and that is to defuse any notions that this is aiming something at somebody in Europe. This is all aiming to protect people in Europe.Yes, I mean, the truth of the matter is, the Russian system could overwhelm the missile defense systems we have envisioned. I mean, these systems are designed to deal with, you know, limited launch capabilities. And they've got multiple launch capabilities. And so it's just\u2014it requires a lot of work. We're dealing with a lot of history and a lot of suspicion throughout governments. And so the President and I will try to work through these for our common good. And I'm hopeful we can have some breakthroughs. We'll see.The other thing is, is that this will be my last chance to visit with him face to face, as you know, and I've worked with him for 8 years. We've had a very interesting relationship. I like him. He's a person that has been a strong leader for Russia. And my view all along has been that it's in our interest\u2014our interests, Ukrainian interests, European interests\u2014to be able to have a working relationship with Russia. And I've had that. And this will be a chance to say, I appreciate being able to work together, and to be able to try to find some common interests in the waning days of his Presidency.",
    "I think that, first of all, Iraq is a sovereign nation which is conducting its own foreign policy. They're having talks with their neighbors. And if that's what they think they ought to do, that's fine. I hope their talks yield results. One result that Iraq would like to see is for the Iranians to leave them alone. If Iran is going to be involved in their country, they ought to be involved in a constructive way, encouraging peace. That is the message that the Iranians\u2014the Iraqis have delivered to the Iranians. That's the message that Prime Minister Maliki has made clear, that he expects the neighbors to encourage peaceful development of the country.As far as the United States goes, Iran knows how to get to the table with us, and that is to do that which they said they would do, which is verifiably suspend their enrichment programs. One of the concerns that I have about the Iranian regime is their desire to develop a nuclear weapon, and you ought to be concerned about it too. The idea of this regime having a nuclear weapon by which they could blackmail the world is unacceptable to free nations. And that's why we're working through the United Nations to send a clear message that the EU-3 and the United States, Russia, and China do not accept their desires to have a nuclear weapon.There is a better way forward for the Iranian people. And if they would like to be at the table discussing this issue with the United States, I have made it abundantly clear how they can do so, and that is, verifiably suspend the enrichment program. And then we'll be happy to have a dialog with them.But as far as Iraq goes, the Iraqi Government is a sovereign government that is capable of handling its own foreign policies and is in the process of doing so. And they have made it abundantly clear, and I agree with them, that the Iranians and the Syrians should help, not destabilize this young democracy.Thank you. Thank you very much.",
    "David, I'm wise enough to remind you that I'm not an economist, and that I would ask you direct predictions and forecasts about economic matters to those who make a living making forecasts and predictions. I suspect you'll find, on the one hand; on the other hand, in how they predict. []Now, what I focus on are the fundamentals of our economy. My belief is that people will make rational decision based upon facts. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. I mentioned some of them before. Job creation is strong; real after-tax wages are on the rise; inflation is low. Interestingly enough, the global economy is strong, which has enabled us to gain more exports, which helped the second-quarter growth numbers to be robust at 3.4 percent.Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. In other words, is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct? And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct. One area where we can help consumer\u2014 and, obviously, anybody who loses their home is somebody with whom we must show enormous empathy.The word bailout, I'm not exactly sure what you mean. If you mean direct grants to homeowners, the answer would be no, I don't support that. If you mean making sure that financial institutions like the FHA have got flexibility to help these folks refinance their homes, the answer is yes, I support that.One thing is for certain, is that there needs to be more transparency in the\u2014 in financial documents. In other words, a lot of people sign up to something they're not exactly sure what they're signing up for. More financial literacy, I guess, is the best way to put it. We've had a lot of really hard-working Americans sign up for loans, and the truth of the matter is, they probably didn't fully understand what they were signing up for. And therefore, I do believe it's a proper role for Government to enhance financial education initiatives. And we're doing that; we've got money in the budget to do that.Let's see here\u2014Mike [Michael Emanuel, FOX News].",
    "Let me see if I understood your question properly. First question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty. And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question? I just want to make sure that I'm responsive to your question. I guess I ought to answer on the drones. And Guantanamo, that was a question, I believe, addressed to you. . Okay. Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo. It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there's been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues, I need congressional authorization.But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so. Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade. One war, I think, in Afghanistan, was necessary. One war I disagreed with strongly. But in either case, there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing.The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant, and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don't intend and do not want for the future. I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality.Some of thepeople at Guantanamo are dangerous. Some of them did bad things. But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they're being held even as we're ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these\u2014the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.So I'm confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you're right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked. One of the things you discover as a politician is, is that people don't always do exactly what you want. It's shocking. And then you have to keep on working at it.One thing with respect to drone policy: In that speech that I gave, I also addressed that issue of\u2014that, the lethal targeting of identified terrorists. This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly. And as we defeat Al Qaida, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used. I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter\u2014as part of our counterterrorism activities. And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case. That is not. Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here. They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism. If I think of Ramstein, for example\u2014and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder to shoulder here. And we provide bases for our activities, and our work is based also on shared values. As I said, we exchange on\u2014have exchanges on values. But I think it's good. I think it's the right thing to do for the United States of America to be present here with military bases in Germany. It's a normal thing within an alliance, and this is as it should be and as it will be and continue to be.",
    "Well, I won't go into details of my conversations with President-elect Trump. As I've said before, they are cordial. At times, they've been fairly lengthy, and they've been substantive. I can't tell you how convincing I've been. I think you'd have to ask him whether I've been convincing or not.I have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And my working assumption is, is that having won an election opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don't expect that there's going to be enormous overlap.It may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to, in fact, provide health care for everybody\u2014something he says he wants to do\u2014or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here.But I don't think we'll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisers, the people around him, which is why it's important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings.I can tell you that\u2014and this is something I have told him\u2014that this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team: your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their twenties and thirties, but who are executing on significant responsibilities.And so how you put a team together to make sure that they're getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions, that's probably the most useful advice, the most constructive advice that I've been able to give him. That if you find yourself isolated because the process breaks down, or if you're only hearing from people who agree with you on everything, or if you haven't created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes. And as I indicated in some of my previous remarks, reality has a way of biting back if you're not paying attention to it.With respect to the Inauguration, I'm not going to comment on those issues. All I know is I'm going to be there. [] So is Michelle.

    "Well, the vaccine\u2014at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we've stepped it up very substantially.And now\u2014I mean, I'm just telling you the\u2014this is just what it is. We've been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up. I freed up the FDA. Dr. Hahn has done a great job. And they're ready to approve something when they come in.The other thing that's happening that's very different is\u2014you look at a company like Pfizer, a great company\u2014really, one of the great companies of the world. Johnson & Johnson. They're all great companies. They're doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody has ever seen anything like it. You know, they're out in third\u2014they're in the third level of trial. And I think that you're going to see things that are amazing.When I made statements like that\u2014that's an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we're producing. But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast.If this were a\u2014an administration from the past\u2014and I think I can say far beyond Obama, if\u2014it was other administrations also\u2014you wouldn't have a vaccine for 2\u00bd, 3 years.

I don't think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out. But he wanted to wait until after the IG report. The IG report has now come, and we've learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report, as you know very well.And I think he'll go through a process, and it will go fairly quickly. He's a very respected man, somebody that I've gotten that like; somebody who really has\u2014he's someone who's really distinguished himself and, I think, over the last year and a half, 2 years, in particular.

And he's now dealing with the Taliban.But we're talking about 19 years we've been there. Nineteen years. And other Presidents have tried to do this. The Taliban has given a pledge\u2014and a very strong pledge\u2014and we'll see how that all works out. We hope it's going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists.

    "I will send more troops to Iraq if General Casey says, I need more troops in Iraq to achieve victory. And that's the way I've been running this war. I have great faith in General Casey. I have great faith in Ambassador Khalilzad. I trust our commanders on the ground to give the best advice about how to achieve victory. I want to remind you, victory is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself\u2014 a country that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself and serves as an ally in the war on terror\u2014which stands in stark contrast to a government that would be chaotic, that would be a safe haven for the enemy to launch attacks on us.One way for the American people to understand what Iraq could look like is what Afghanistan looked like under the Taliban, a place where there was no freedom; a place where women were taken to the public square and beaten if they did not adhere to the strict, intolerant guidelines of the Taliban; a place where thousands trained to attack America and our allies. Afghanistan doesn't have nearly the resources that Iraq has. Imagine a safe haven for an enemy that ended up with the resources that it had.It is\u2014and so this is a war where I say to our generals, Do you have what it takes to win? Now, General Casey talked about part of our strategy, and part of the strategy is to give the Iraq Government the tools necessary to protect itself, to defend itself. If you're able to defend yourself, you're more likely to be able to govern yourself as well. But politics\u2014the political way forward and the military way forward must go hand in hand.And what the General was saying yesterday is that there is a three-step process to enable the Iraqi forces to be able to help this Government bring security. One was to train and equip. The goal is 325,000 troops, 137,000 military and the balance, police.Second was to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead. Six of ten divisions now are in the lead in helping this Government defend itself. The strategy has been to embed U.S. personnel, officers and non-com officers, into these forces to help them gain the confidence and the capacity to be effective when they're in the lead.And the third step is for the Iraqi security forces to be able to operate independently. And this, perhaps, is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of having the Iraqis ready to go, because that means they have to be able to drive themselves, maintain their vehicles, provide logistics, have combat service support. And that's what General Casey was describing.The key is that our commanders feel that there\u2014they have got enough flexibility to design the program to meet the conditions on the ground. You know, last spring, I thought for a period of time we'd be able to reduce our troop presence early next year. That's what I felt. But because we didn't have a fixed timetable and because General Casey and General Abizaid and the other generals there understand that the way we're running this war is to give them flexibility, have the confidence necessary to come and make the right recommendations here in Washington, DC, they decided that that wasn't going to happen. And so what he was describing to you was the way forward to make sure that the Iraqis are fully prepared to defend themselves.",

    "Jennifer [Jennifer Loven, Associated Press], I'll be glad to share some of the private conversation with His Holy Father. First, I'll give you an impression. I was talking to a very smart, loving man. And I\u2014you know, after 61\u20442 years of being the President, I've seen some unusual\u2014 I've been to some unusual places, and I've met some interesting people. And I was in awe, and it was a moving experience for me.We didn't talk about just war. He did express deep concern about the Christians inside Iraq, that he was concerned that the society that was evolving would not tolerate the Christian religion. And I assured him we're working hard to make sure that they\u2014people lived up to the Constitution, that modern Constitution voted on by the people that would honor people from different walks of life and different attitudes.We talked about a lot of other subjects. We talked about our attempts to help the people in Africa deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and hunger. I reminded him that we made a significant commitment to that end, that about 3 years ago, 50,000 people were getting antiretroviral drugs. Now over 1,100,000 people are getting them, as a result of our initiative on HIV/AIDS, and that I'm going to double that commitment\u2014or ask Congress to double the commitment from 15 billion to 30 billion.I talked to him about our malaria program, about how we intend to reduce malaria by 50 percent in certain countries, and that I'd continue to remind the world of our duty to work together to achieve a major goal, which is to try to eradicate malaria throughout Africa.And I talked to him about our attempts to feed the hungry, and I also reminded him that we've got poor people in our own neighborhood that need to be affected.He talked about immigration. He's watching the immigration debate very closely in America. And I told him I was a person who strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform that, on the one hand, we'll enforce our law; on the other hand, we need to treat people with dignity. And we had a good discussion.",
    "No. [] I will tell them when I make the announcement. But it was\u2014it's a good try though. That was a good angle. [] Jim and I go way back, although he actually\u2014he was famous, I was not. He used to be a broadcaster in Chicago, so I used to watch him on TV. You've aged a little better than I have. [] Yes.All right. People of Australia, thank you again for your wonderful hospitality.",
    "Yes, microphone being loud means\u2014is that I'm able to help focus people's attentions on important issues. That's what I was referring to. In other words, the President is in a position to speak about priorities. Whether or not we can get those priorities done is going to take bipartisan cooperation, which I believe was one of the lessons of the campaigns.I will tell you, I felt like we had a pretty successful couple of years when it comes to legislation. After all, we reformed Medicare; we put tax policy in place that encouraged economic growth and vitality; we passed trade initiatives; passed a comprehensive energy bill. I'm signing an important piece of legislation today that continues a comprehensive approach to energy exploration, plus extenders on R&D, for example, tax credits. It's been a pretty substantial legislative record if you carefully scrutinize it.However, that doesn't mean necessarily that we are able to achieve the same kind of results without a different kind of approach. After all, you're right; the Democrats now control the House and the Senate. And therefore, I will continue to work with their leadership\u2014and our own leaders, our own Members\u2014to see if we can't find common ground on key issues like Social Security or immigration.I strongly believe that we can and must get a comprehensive immigration plan on my desk this year. It's important for us because, in order to enforce our border, in order for those Border Patrol agents who we've increased down there and given them more equipment and better border security, they've got to have help and a plan that says, If you're coming into America to do a job, you can come legally for a temporary basis to do so.I don't know if you've paid attention to the enforcement measures that were taken recently where in some of these packing plants they found people working that had been here illegally, but all of them had documents that said they were here legally. They were using forged documents, which just reminded me that the system we have in place has caused people to rely upon smugglers and forgers in order to do work Americans aren't doing.In other words, it is a system that is all aimed to bypass no matter what measures we take to protect this country. It is a system that, frankly, leads to inhumane treatment of people. And therefore, the best way to deal with an issue that Americans agree on\u2014that is, that we ought to enforce our borders in a humane way\u2014 is we've got to have a comprehensive bill.And I have made a proposal. I have spoken about this to the Nation from the Oval Office. I continue to believe that the microphone is necessary to call people to action. And I want to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get a comprehensive bill to my desk. It's in our interest that we do this.In terms of energy, there's another area where I know we can work together. There is a consensus that we need to move forward with continued research on alternative forms of energy. I've just described them in my opening comments, and be glad to go over them again if you'd like, because they're positive. It's a positive development. We're making progress, and there's more to be done.So I'm looking forward to working with them. There's a lot of attitude here that says, Well, you lost the Congress; therefore, you're not going to get anything done. Quite the contrary; I have an interest to get things done. And the Democrat leaders have an interest to get something done to show that they're worthy of their leadership roles. And it is that common ground that I'm confident we can get\u2014 we can make positive progress, without either of us compromising principle.And I know they don't\u2014I know they're not going to change their principles, and I'm not going to change mine. But nevertheless, that doesn't mean we can't find common ground to get good legislation done. That's what the American people want. The truth of the matter is, the American people are sick of the partisanship and name-calling.I will do my part to elevate the tone, and I'm looking forward to working with them. It's going to be an interesting new challenge. I'm used to it, as Herman [Ken Herman, Cox News] can testify. I was the Governor of Texas with Democrat leadership in the house and the senate, and we were able to get a lot of constructive things done for the State of Texas. And I believe it's going to be possible here\u2014to do so here in the country.Michael [Michael Allen, Time].",
    "I have got cordial relations with the leaders when I talk to them. I saw Speaker Pelosi last night at the Congressional Ball at the White House, and we have very cordial relations. Here's\u2014 Congress\u2014the Democrats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, need to work out their differences before they come to the White House. You can imagine what it's like to try to deal on an important piece of legislation, and the Democrats in the House have one opinion, and the Democrats in the Senate have another opinion. FISA is a good example.And in order for us to be able to reach accord, they've got to come with one voice, one position. And it's\u2014nobody\u2014like, the most disappointing thing about Washington has been the name-calling and this kind of\u2014people go out in front of the mikes, and they just kind of unleash. And I've tried hard not to do that. I've tried to be respectful to all parties. And that's disappointing.On the other hand, I think we can get some things done. The Peruvian trade vote is one; there's an example. And the Congress needs to get their differences sorted. One of the worst ways to negotiate is to negotiate with one group. They pocket your negotiations, and then another group shows up and says, Well, you've said this to them, now give us this.And hopefully, as we come down the stretch here, that they're capable of coming forward with, Here's what we believe; here's our plan; here's what we would like you to consider, as opposed to some examples, which is passing legislation for the sake of the headline, as opposed to passing legislation to get it passed. And SCHIP is a classic example. They knew I was going to veto the bill. They knew that was going to happen. They knew the veto would be sustained. But they ate up valuable time and passed the bill anyway.And so we sit here in the White House trying to figure out why. Why would you waste time? Why wouldn't you sit down and try to seriously negotiate an agreement on a bill that they knew was going to get vetoed and sustained?Now, hopefully, in the next\u2014however long they intend to stay here, that we're capable of working together. But if not, I'm going to stand strong for certain principles, and one of which is to make sure our troops get funded. We've got men and women in combat. We've got people risking their lives for the United States of America. And this Congress has yet to fund them, and it needs to. And it needs to fund them without telling our military how to conduct this war. Arbitrary dates for withdrawal are unacceptable, particularly given the fact that the strategy is working\u2014it's working.And it seems like to me that this Congress ought to be congratulating our military commanders and our troops. And one way to send a congratulatory message is to give them the funds they need, and now is the time to do it.Let's see here, Mark Silva [Chicago Tribune].",

    "Yes. I don't\u2014you know, quagmire is an interesting word. If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny, you'd be saying, God, I love freedom. Because that's what's happened. And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom. But freedom is happening in Iraq, and we're making progress.And I can't thank the President enough for sending his Foreign Minister to Baghdad. It was a clear message that freedom matters, that when people are struggling to live in freedom, that those of us who have the comfort of a free society ought to help them.We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands. I reminded a TV reporter\u2014I don't know if the person is here or not\u2014 but I said, I just want to remind you that 1441 was supported by France and the United States, which clearly said to the dictator, you will disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. Now, I'm the kind of person that when somebody says something, I take them for their word.Having said that, we had a difference of opinion. But I don't sense any difference of opinion now that a struggling democracy wants help from those of us who live in the comfort of free societies. And, Mr. President, the strong gesture of sending your Foreign Minister there wasn't a message to the United States, because we're good friends; it was message to the Iraqi citizens that said: We hear your cries for freedom; we want you to succeed, because one of the lessons of history is, free societies yield peace.And so I appreciate your leadership on that issue, and I want to thank your Foreign Minister for\u2014I don't see your Foreign Minister. Look, the guy was here. [] Oh, there he is, yes, next to\u2014look, the President was blocking\u2014next to Madam Rice. Anyway, thank you, sir. Allow me to give you two answers in one. On , yes, we're worried about the situation. It's worrisome, and we need to have elections as swiftly as possible. You cannot combat extremism using the same methods as extremists, and it is very important, it is of the essence that organize elections. I, like President Bush, I wish this to take place as speedily as possible.Let me remind you that this is a country of 150 million inhabitants who happens to have nuclear weapons. This is very important for us that one day we shouldn't wake up with a government, an administration in which is in the hands of the extremists. And we should, each and every one of us, think about this, of the principles, the values that we uphold and that we defend and we must continue to uphold. And then there's the complexity, as it were, in the field. That's why it's important to convene election, call elections.Now, on Iraq, Bernard Kouchner's trip to Iraq was very successful. What does France want? A united Iraq. No one\u2014no, it is in no one's interest to see Iraq dismantled. We want a democratic Iraq. We want a diverse Iraq, where each component element of Iraqi society has learned to live with others; an Iraq which is\u2014which can administer and govern itself and that has the means of ensuring the peace and security of every one of its citizens. And that is exactly Bernard Kouchner's message when he went to Iraq. And this is in the interest of one and all that it be thus, and that position is the position I will defend until the end.

    "We have made it clear to high-ranking officials, whether they be Republicans or Democrats, that going to sends mixed signals\u2014signals in the region and, of course, mixed signals to President Asad. And by that, I mean, photo opportunities and/or meetings with President Asad lead the Asad Government to believe they're part of the mainstream of the international community, when, in fact, they're a state sponsor of terror; when, in fact, they're helping expedite\u2014or at least not stopping the movement of foreign fighters from into Iraq; when, in fact, they have done little to nothing to rein in militant Hamas and Hizballah; and when, in fact, they destabilize the Lebanese democracy.There have been a lot of people who have gone to see President Asad\u2014some Americans, but a lot of European leaders, high-ranking officials. And yet we haven't seen action; in other words, he hasn't responded. It's one thing to send a message, it's another thing to have the person receiving the message actually do something. So the position of this administration is that the best way to meet with a leader like Asad or people from is in the larger context of trying to get the global community to help change his behavior. But sending delegations hasn't worked. It's just simply been counterproductive.Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].",
    "Well, we're going to\u2014our objective is to make sure that ISIL is not a ongoing threat to the region. And we can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, and it's going to take some effort. As we've seen with Al Qaida, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities. You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we've seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims\u2014Shia, Sunni\u2014terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we've seen it being over the last several months. .

    "I've written them personal letters. They've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend.

It's the toughest\u2014the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It's a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day\u2014it's a very, very tough day. For me, that's by far the toughest.So, the traditional way\u2014if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls. I like to call when it's appropriate, when I think I'm able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice.So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I'm going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I'm going to be calling them. I have\u2014as you know, since I've been President, I have.

They want me to be the President and let Senators be Senators.And so, if I've made\u2014and I've made many mistakes, I'm sure.

And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done.

One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded.

Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people.

In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob.

And they\u2014 well, they say, you never meet people who disagree; that's just not true. I've met a lot of people who don't agree with the decisions I make. But they have been civil in their discourse.And so I view those who get angry and yell and say bad things and, you know, all that kind of stuff, it's just a very few people in the country. I don't know why they get angry. I don't know why they get hostile. It's not the first time, however, in history that people have expressed themselves in sometimes undignified ways. I've been reading, you know, a lot about Abraham Lincoln during my Presidency, and there was some pretty harsh discord when it came to the 16th President, just like there's been harsh discord for the 30\u201443d President.You know, Presidents can try to avoid hard decisions, and therefore, avoid controversy. That's just not my nature. I'm the kind of person that, you know, is willing to take on hard tasks, and in times of war people get emotional, I understand that.

    "I think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries. I think it's\u2014the way we have it now, I think it's a much\u2014I think NATO got\u2014you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office. Thenumbers were going down. Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship. The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly. And they're now going up further.So I think NATO is going to be very, very effective. I'm very impressed with\u2014and really know, and he's a friend mine\u2014but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together. And we were the ones that really\u2014we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know. I think he's done a really good job.I think that when I was saying that, I am very concerned with the pipeline; I don't like the pipeline. And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO? And then, you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against. But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against. I think that's a real possibility.As you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday. And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much. We want to find out about Syria. We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling. I will be asking that question again. But we'll also be talking about other things. We'll be talking about Ukraine. Ukraine was here today, by the way. And you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say. So\u2014\u2014",

So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be\u2014what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, I'm out.But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do.

    "Well, this was an extensive topic of conversation and concrete action that we're now taking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab.In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together\u2014Uganda, Ethiopia, others\u2014we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa.That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage.And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long.There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there.In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving.And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience\u2014and I shared this with \u2014is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized.And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them\u2014to their young people through social media\u2014is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful.The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society\u2014in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab\u2014that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse.Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people?If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently\u2014not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different\u2014that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's\u2014were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong.So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs\u2014[]\u2014and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. And the state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine. The state just has to say, we're going to treat everybody equally under the law. And then, everybody else can have their own opinions. All right?",
    "Thanks. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children.And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the\u2014Ghana a better place.Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders\u2014I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we\u2014I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help.In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi.Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect.And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders.I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met\u2014not every single leader\u2014 but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy\u2014a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am here. It's been a great trip, and it's\u2014and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura.Let's see here, John McKinnon. He would be from your Wall Street Journal. Yes, that's a pretty sophisticated paper, no question about that.",
    "Well, first of all, what we're doing\u2014and we're\u2014if you look at the Department of Labor also\u2014Secretary separately\u2014Secretary Azar, what they've done. They've come up with some incredible health care plans, which is causing great competition and driving the prices right down.But we are getting rid of the individual mandate, because it was very unfair to a lot of people. But at the same time, we're covering the people that need it. But the individual mandate was a disaster, because people that couldn't necessarily afford it were having to pay for the privilege of not having to pay for health care. And it was bad health care at that.",
    "You know, I'm going to go back home and take a look at the intentions and purpose of the meeting. There will be a high-level official, for certain, from my administration. We ought to be at the table as producers. My call on Congress is to recognize the seriousness of the problem and pass law that encourages exploration for oil and gas in the United States so that down the road, an American President will go as a producer, not a consumer.And our policies frankly have been\u2014are now coming home to roost. For 8 years, I have been saying to the Congress, we ought to be exploring in ANWR; we ought to be drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. And the Democratically led Congress has prevented that from happening. And now the prices of gasoline are high, and the American people don't like it, and I can understand why they don't like it. In the interim term, we'll\u2014we need to be finding more oil and gas. In the longer term, we ought be diversifying away from our reliance upon oil.And so yes, I'm interested in the meeting. I said it's an interesting idea. And I'm going to get home and take a look, and we'll send somebody high level there.Thank you. Thank you very much. And now to the Italian journalists. Firstly, we have a journalist from Channel One news, our Susanna Petruni.",
    "No. Not at all. Not even a little bit. No, I'm not interested. We signed the deal. I had heard that too: They'd like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them.China has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, for decades, because we had people at this position, right here where I'm standing, sitting right in that office\u2014the Oval Office\u2014that allowed that to happen.No, I'm not interested in that. Let's see if they live up to the deal that they signed. Okay?Please, go ahead.",

Nothing easy\u2014nothing easy, but he's doing a very good job.We're talking\u2014I mean, while we're at it, we're talking about China and India. They're pretty\u2014going at a pretty good on the border, as you know. It's been very nasty. It's been a very nasty situation, and we stand ready to help, with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help, and we are talking to both countries about that.But I appreciate your nice sentiments. They think a lot of India, and so do I. And I think a lot of your Prime Minister. Thank you.",
    "We got a fine man named Joel Bagnal working that office right now. He's a professional. I trust his judgment. He's a real good guy. And no, they shouldn't worry about Joel. He knows what he's doing.John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].",
    "Well, look, first of all, theI am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.And so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chineseno one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.And so, really, what this trip was aboutit was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.And I think that one of the things we've doneI've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 monthsis, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.That's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.And it'sfor example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doingwhy was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, To maintain stability. It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the roadeverything from airspace and space in the ocean isthe international rules of the road are abided by.And soand I hope thatI think that Prime Minister XiI mean, Xi has somesome difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he's working his way through. I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules.The next question was to Bloomberg.",
    "Well, first of all, let's be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.It has been my view that given she went to trial, that due process was carried out, that she took responsibility for her crime, that the sentence that she received was very disproportional\u2014disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received, and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made it sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of Government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that had been put in place.I recognize that there's some folks who think they're not enough, and I think all of us, when we're working in big institutions, may find ourselves at times at odds with policies that are set. But when it comes to national security, we're often dealing with people in the field whose lives may be put at risk or the safety and security and the ability of our military or our intelligence teams or Embassies to function effectively. And that has to be kept in mind.So with respect to WikiLeaks, I don't see a contradiction. First of all, I haven't commented on WikiLeaks, generally. The conclusions of the intelligence community with respect to the Russian hacking were not conclusive as to whether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being the conduit through which we heard about the DNC e-mails that were leaked. I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance. And I'd refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.What I can say broadly is that, in this new cyber age, we're going to have to make sure that we continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us, whether that's in trying to commit financial crimes or trying to commit acts of terrorism or folks who want to interfere with our elections.And we're going to have to continually build the kind of architecture that makes sure our\u2014the best of our democracy is preserved; that our national security and intelligence agencies have the ability to carry out policy without advertising to our adversaries what it is that we're doing, but do so in a way that still keeps citizens up to speed on what their Government is doing on their behalf.But with respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case the same way I have for the other commutations and pardons that I've done, and I felt that in light of all the circumstances that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.Margaret Brennan [CBS News].",
    "I think they are. I think they are. First of all, Iraq is\u2014after the overthrow of the tyrant, voted on a Constitution that is intended to unite the whole country. And then they had elections under that Constitution, where nearly 12 million people voted for this unity Government. Secondly\u2014which is different from Vietnam.Secondly, in terms of our troops, this is a volunteer army. Vietnam wasn't a volunteer army, as you know. And in this Volunteer Army, the troops understand the consequences of Iraq and the global war on terror. That's why reenlistment rates are up, and that's why enlistment is high.Thirdly, the support for our troops is strong here in the United States, and it wasn't during the Vietnam era. So I see differences; I really do. And you hear all the time, Well, this may be a civil war. Well, I don't believe it is, and the Maliki Government doesn't believe it is. Zal, our Ambassador, doesn't believe it is. But we've got to make sure it isn't by implementing a strategy which helps\u2014a politics strategy which helps unify the country and a security strategy that makes sure that the Iraqis are better capable of fighting off the extremists and the radicals that want to stop progress in Iraq.So I don't think it is a parallel.Mike [Michael Allen, Time].",
    "Well first of all you know I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.When we have a deal with China\u2014or not\u2014but when we have a deal with China\u2014because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.But when\u2014and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.So I will say though that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.And in the meantime as you know I did tariff relief with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally and we work very well together.But you\u2014your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well. That's true. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing\u2014large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.Please. Thanks. Mr. President Australia is in its 29th year of consecutive economic growth which is an extraordinary national achievement. And we will continue to grow as our most recent national accounts demonstrated.Australia is also very used to dealing with a complex and changing world. And that's why we've diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years. I mean 6 years ago when our government came to office 27 percent of our trade was covered by agreements around the world. That figure is now 70 percent and we're going to take that to 90 percent. And that's important. And that's opening up opportunities.So there are ebbs and flows that go in the global economy and Australia has built up a resilience through the broad-based nature in which we're taking our economy to the world. I mean Australia has never got rich selling things to itself. And we've always had an outward looking perspective when it comes to engaging our economic opportunities.And a big part of what we've been discussing here is some new opportunities whether it's in the rare earth metals the critical minerals the frontier technologies space. You know this is where jobs are going to be in the future as well. And so we will deal with those ebbs and flows as they come.But the President is right: The arrangement they will come to\u2014and I'm confident they will\u2014with China will be one that will set you know a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future with developed economies like Australia. So we look on with interest. And I think ultimately when we arrive at that point it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing. And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it clean coal but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to\u2014because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people. And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day and coal miners are very very safe in Australia. True. It's incredible what you've done. In fact we're looking at what you've done. [] But so\u2014\u2014 We can do a deal on that. So I want to\u2014I want to\u2014we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal.Yes. Go ahead. Please.",
    "I'm in constant contact with leaders throughout the Middle East, and I've had a fairly consistent message to all of them: Number one, the United States believes in the right of peaceful protests and the ability of ordinary people to express their grievances to their government. And we oppose the use of violence in response to peaceful protests. So that's one clear message that we tried to send.The second message we've try to send is that it is in the interest of the entire region to reform itself: to reform itself both politically and economically so that the incredible talents of young people throughout that region can be tapped; so that the young man, whether he is in Sanaa or he's in Tripoli or she's in Cairo or Amman, that they know that if they work hard, if they are getting an education, that they have an opportunity to live a better life, that they can get a job that pays a good wage and supports their family, and that they can have the basic necessities of life, and that they have personal security and they have personal freedom.Now, each country is different, and so the evolution, the process towards that vision is going to differ in each country. But my consistent message to leaders in the region is that this process of change can be a great opportunity for the Middle East, because if you can tap into the talents of those young people, then you can start seeing the kind of economic growth in that region that you've started to see in other places in the world.And there's no reason why countries in the Middle East shouldn't have the same kind of growth rates that you're seeing in China and India. There's nothing inherent about the people in those countries that would prevent that. What's preventing it is the fact that for many decades you've seen a lack of opening up that allows you to take advantage of the global economy.And I think that, as I said, each country is going to be different, and it's going to ultimately be up to the people in those countries to determine the best form for them to seize this opportunity, but we should be on the side of those who want to seize this opportunity.Okay?",
    "Well, we're going to do a report. Yes, I fired those people; they're all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we're going to give you a big report that's going to make you very happy.All right, yes, please.",
    "I had naturally several interactions with President Putin during the course of the APEC summit and then here at the G-20. I would characterize them as typical of our interactions, which are businesslike and blunt. And my communications to him was no different than what I've said publicly as well as what I've said to him privately over the course of this crisis in Ukraine, and that is, Russia has the opportunity to take a different path, to resolve the issue of Ukraine in a way that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and is consistent with international law. That is our preference, and if it does so, then I will be the first to suggest that we roll back the sanctions that are frankly having a devastating effect on the Russian economy.If he continues down the path that he is on\u2014violating international law, providing heavy arms to the separatists in Ukraine, violating an agreement that he agreed to just a few weeks ago, the Minsk agreement, that would have lowered the temperature and the killing in the disputed areas and make providing us a pathway for a diplomatic resolution\u2014then the isolation that Russia is currently experiencing will continue.And in my meeting with European leaders, they confirmed their view that so far, Russia has not abided by either the spirit or the letter of the agreement that Mr. Putin signed\u2014or agreed to, and that as a consequence, we are going to continue to maintain the economic isolation while maintaining the possibility of a diplomatic solution.It is not our preference to see Russia isolated the way it is. We would prefer a Russia that is fully integrated with the global economy, that is thriving on behalf of its people, that can once again engage with us in cooperative efforts around global challenges. But we're also very firm on the need to uphold core international principles. And one of those principles is, is that you don't invade other countries or finance proxies and support them in ways that break up a country that has mechanisms for democratic elections.",
    "Well, I think it's very sad. I look at what's happened, and it's a very, very sad thing. Who has ever heard of anything like this? Abducted by a hostile country for purposes of language, for purposes of\u2014could be any number of another reasons. We'll see what happens in terms of the ultimate conclusion.But I did put it in my speech at the United Nations, and many people in Japan were really thrilled that I did because a lot of people thought that the folks we're talking about were forgotten about. Like I say, the forgotten people\u2014where they were, maybe they're forgotten people\u2014but I can tell you, your great Prime Minister did not forget. He didn't forget at all.So we'll work together and see if we can do something. Now the spotlight is on and perhaps we can have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back. I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back. If he would send them back, that would be the start of something\u2014I think, would be just something very special if they would do that.But I spoke with people who were devastated, and they've been devastated for many years. They think they're alive, but they don't know. Probably makes it even tougher that way. But we'll see what happens. Thank you. Thank you.

    "On Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk agreement; we need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk; that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place.There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. We\u2014those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political level, because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions. But I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared.Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk agreement is met. And I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done.Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He's got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire, or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?And as I mentioned earlier, the costs that the Russian people are bearing are severe. That's being felt. It may not always be understood why they're suffering, because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of state media in Russia and to Russian speakers. But the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian people would greatly benefit. And ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They're suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk agreement is fully implemented.Christi\u2014oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I'm frustrated by a district court ruling that now is wending its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court.But obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check\u2014criminal background check\u2014pay back taxes, and then have a legal status. And that requires an entire administrative apparatus and us getting them to apply and come clean.I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security's legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we're doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we're doing is lawful.But the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and when a\u2014even if it's a individual district court judge who's making this determination, we've got to go through the process to challenge it. And until we get clarity there, I don't want to bring people in, have them apply and jump through a lot of hoops, only to have it deferred and delayed further.Of course, there's one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American people, I think, still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic of the next Presidential campaign.And so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system. Administratively, we'll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about our authorities to go ahead and implement. But ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act. And my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we're working on currently get cleared, that there\u2014some quiet conversations start up\u2014back up again, particularly in the Republican Party, about the shortsighted approach that they're taking when it comes to immigration.Okay.

    "Well, I thought it was really brilliant. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is doing a fantastic job, I think he's a star. And he made a statement that I'll just read: Justice is not often easy. It does not fit the mold of public opinion and it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice\u2014it just becomes revenge.I mean, I heard that, I said, Write that down for me, please. Because I think it's\u2014it was a terrific statement. He's handling it very well. You know who he is, right? You\u2014I think you know. I think everyone now knows who he is.I will be speaking to the Governor.

And it will all work out.",

    "I'm very aware that a lot of our systems are vulnerable to cyber attack from a variety of places. And therefore, the first question should be\u2014not to put questions in your mouth, Bret, but\u2014 what are you doing to defend America against cyber attack? Are you aware that we have vulnerabilities, that people can hack into sensitive systems? And are you then providing expertise and technology necessary to defend? And the answer is, yes. We understand that we're vulnerable in some systems, some, by the way, more valuable than others\u2014or less valuable than others, I guess, is the best way to put it.In terms of whether or not I'll bring this up to countries that we suspect may\u2014 from which there may have been an attack, I may. In this instance, I don't have the intelligence at my fingertips right now. Whether it be this issue or issues like intellectual property rights, I mean, if you have a relationship with a country, then you've got to respect the country's systems and knowledge base. And that's what we expect from people with whom we trade.Our relationship with China is complex. On the one hand, we appreciate the opportunity to trade goods and services. We certainly hope that China changes from a saving society to a consuming society. Right now, because of the lack of a safety net, many Chinese save for what we call a rainy day. What we want is the Government to provide more of a safety net so they start buying more and Australian products. We want there to be a\u2014the middle class to feel comfortable coming into the marketplace, the global marketplace, so that our producers can see the benefits directly with trade with China.By the way, our exports to China are up, Mr. Prime Minister, which is positive. We still have got a huge trade deficit with China, which then causes us to want to work with them to adjust\u2014to let their currency float. We think that would be helpful in terms of adjusting trade balances.We've got great relations with China from a diplomatic perspective. In other words, we're able to talk with them openly and candidly. But do we agree on every issue? Not at all. I mean, for example, I've spent time talking about dissidents who have been jailed. I'm concerned about the treatment of the Dalai Lama. I want China to be more aggressive when it comes to Iran. I'm interested to hear President Hu Jintao's attitudes toward the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. In other words, there's a lot of issues which we wish they would have a different lean to their policy, so I'm going to discuss these with him. But it's best to be able to discuss these issues in an environment that is frank and open and friendly, as opposed to one in which there's tension and suspicion.And so when I say we've got great relations, I will sit down with the President and have a good, honest, candid discussion. And he's going to tell me what's on his mind, and I'm darned sure going to tell him what's on my mind.One area where we are making good progress is on North Korea. As you may remember, I shifted the whole strategic approach to North Korea. I'm convinced that it's more effective to have five countries to say to North Korea the same thing than just one country, so that if North Korea makes the decision not to honor their word, that there's a better chance that there's consequences that they'll feel. And so as a result of getting China to the table on North Korea, the North Koreans are going to realize there is a lot more than one voice. And China has been instrumental in helping move this process forward. Chris Hill\u2014Ambassador Hill briefed me and Secretary Rice this morning on the fact that North Korea still looks like they're going to honor their agreement to disclose and to shut down their nuclear programs, which will be good for peace.Anyway, a long answer because it's a complex relationship.

But that will not preclude me from meeting with the Chinese President, expressing my deep concerns about a variety of issues, just like I do every time I meet with the President.And maybe I'm in a little different position. Others don't have a chance to visit with Hu Jintao, but I do. And every time I meet with him, I talk about religious freedom and the importance of China's society recognizing that if you're allowed to worship freely, it will benefit the society as a whole; that the Chinese Government should not fear the idea of people praying to a god as they see fit. A whole society, a healthy society, a confident society is one that recognizes the value of religious freedom.I talk about Darfur and Iran and Burma. And so I am not the least bit shy of bringing up the concerns expressed by this factory worker. And I believe that I'll have an opportunity to do so with the President and, at the same time, enjoy a great sporting event. I'm a sports fan. I'm looking forward to the competition. And each Olympic society will make its own decision as to how to deal with the athletes.Yes, Mark [Mark Smith, Associated Press Radio].",

    "We expect our NATO allies to shoulder the burden necessary to succeed. And to this end, as you know, I've committed 3,200\u20143,500 additional marines to send a clear signal that we're willing to do our part.I was very pleased to listen to the comments of President Sarkozy, where he indicated his willingness to increase troop presence. Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of\u2014 in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people\u2014nations in our alliance\u2014to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this\u2014of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it\u2014and so is the President\u2014it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region. Sure, we have a extremely clear idea if we don't keep the terrorists in Afghanistan. If we will let them free, they'll come in Europe, they'll come in United States. For this reason, we have to win; we have to obtain the victory in Afghanistan.",

    "No, yes, no, yes. [] Next question. [] I haven't\u2014 phew, man. You obviously haven't asked a question in a long time. It was like, you know, one, I haven't seen the final budget. Two, as Donnie Evans said, who is the chairman of the foundation, we'll look at the disclosure requirements and make a decision. Here's the\u2014well, I\u2014there's a lot of people\u2014or some people; I shouldn't say a lot\u2014some people who like to give and don't particularly want their names disclosed, whether it be for this foundation or any other foundation. And so we'll take that into consideration.Thirdly\u2014and what was the other?",
    "First of all, I\u2014we're not in a recession, we're in a slowdown. We grew in the fourth quarter of last year. We haven't had first-quarter growth statistics yet, but there's no question, we're in a slowdown. And yes, people are concerned about it, obviously. I'm\u2014of all the three of us standing up here, I'm probably the most concerned about the slowdown. After all, it's affecting the people who I have the honor of representing.That's why we passed, in working with the Congress, a significant progrowth economic package that will pass back rebates to our citizens, starting in the second week of May. Part of that package also included incentives for large and small businesses to invest in the year 2008. I think this is going to have a positive effect on the economy. Experts say it's going to have a positive effect on the economy. And so we'll see what happens there. The key is for Congress not to raise taxes during this period of time and send a signal that they're not going to raise taxes.You know, the President is plenty capable of handling reform. She's a\u2014he's a good, honest man who cares deeply about the people of Mexico. And he'll do what he thinks is right for the country of Mexico.And in terms of President Uribe, we got no better friend in South America than President Uribe. He believes strongly in rule of law. He's a reformer, and he's working hard to protect his country from a bunch of narcotraffickers who murder innocent people to achieve their objectives. And he ought to have our support. He has the support of the United States of America in many ways, but if we don't agree to a free trade agreement that we honest\u2014 negotiated in good faith with them, it will undermine his efforts, and it will destabilize parts of the world. And it would be a big mistake for the Congress to turn its back on Colombia. I simply want to stress the measures Mexico is adopting before this situation\u2014this slowdown of economic growth in the United States, which obviously affects us. More than 82 percent of our exports go to the United States, and we're adopting a number of measures. One of them is a very aggressive program for public expenditure and infrastructure, not just private spending. To give you an idea, Mexico is going from spending 3 percentage points of the GDP per year on infrastructure to over 51\u20442 percent of the GDP on infrastructure.We're talking about Mexico this year having expenses for infrastructural programs of about $500 billion for private-public programs. That's already showing up in the figures of the first quarter of the year.We're also working on an anticyclic program with very aggressive tax stimulus package for investment in the poorest regions of Mexico, where whoever invests there will get a 100-percent deduction on all investments, and the Federal Government, for a year and a half, will pay all expenses associated with social security, with labor\u2014all the labor costs associated with social security. And that's a very, very strong stimulus package.The first data coming in indicates that for Mexico, our economic activity had 4.25percent growth rate per year. The figures for February and March indicate that industrial activity continues to show about 4 percent growth. So it's a difficult time because of the enormous interconnection among our economies, but we are prepared to face the situation and at a slower place than the one we've had in the past. But we are dealing with the situation. We are moving with everything at the Government's disposal to accelerate the growth of the Mexican economy.I hope that this situation will not continue for very long and that soon the authorities in the United States will be able to completely overcome the situation. I think that the steps taken so far by the fiscal tax monetary authorities in the United States and the Bush administration\u2014and in general\u2014have been appropriate. They have been the right measures, and we hope that they will very soon demonstrate effects so that we have a quick recovery among all our economies. I would just say that in spite of a slowdown of the economy in Canada, the bases of our economy are stable and solid. And we have undertaken measures to ensure the continuous growth in the future.Now, as far as the Colombia situation is concerned, Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with Colombia. And it's important also for the United States and for Mexico to benefit from free trade Colombia.Last year, in the summit, I said that Colombia can have drug trafficking with our countries without a free trade agreement, but if you want legitimate business for all our economies, we need to pursue free trade agreements with Colombia. And I said in New York a few months ago that I worry if the United States in the end refuses this agreement with Colombia.We have important alliance in Colombia. Colombia is fighting against political violence, against the FARC. They fight against drug traffickers. And I think that a rejection of or turning our backs to such an ally as Colombia is\u2014could create long-term problems for our countries in South America.[]\u2014\u2014free trade agreement to have drug trade with Colombia. You're going to have that anyway. If you want to have legitimate trade and see that country progress economically, we need to have a free trade agreement. We need to have a trade agreement with countries like Colombia.And I do worry that if the Colombian free trade agreement is rejected, particularly when that country has taken a lot of efforts to fight political violence and corruption and FARC and drug traffickers, if the United States and our allies turn their back on an important ally in this region, that that will have long-term security consequences for all of our countries in North America. So that does worry the Government of Canada.",
    "Yes, definitely. I believe the reason why we enjoy this relationship is because of the relationship between our two countries. Indeed, we have a different background, but it is maybe because we both are not politicians\u2014or typical politicians. And none of us easily change one's mind. And I think that if you listen to this press conference, you\u2014and watched us, you have the answer to your question.Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA, but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal\u2014an overall deal\u2014that will enable us to deal with the issue of\u2014nuclear issue, but also treat it together with another three issues, which were not being dealt with so far.So should the decision\u2014I mean, we've spent more than an hour, just the two of us\u2014and had the conclusions been that the U.S.\u2014the United States of America would walk away from the JCPOA and France would not move, then our friendship would be wasted. But it is about making sure that we're each taking into account the position and the interests of our reciprocal countries.It is unprecedented. We've never before taken a joint position, a joint stance on Syria the way we did, and on Iran, in favor of a deal that will enable us to cover the four pillars. There is intense work between ourselves and our teams; otherwise, we would not have\u2014we would not be in a position to do as much.In the past, sometimes, France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was\u2014France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not. What was legitimate within an international framework, as two members of the Security Council, and we conducted an unprecedented military intervention at an unprecedented\u2014unprecedented\u2014level of cooperation.And please allow me to pay tribute to our troops, to our armies, and to that of the United Kingdom because we've led a unique operation, a proportionate one, and we were able to do so thanks to this relation that we enjoy.So on Syria, Iran, the credibility of the international community against the use of chemical weapons, you've seen it. You have the evidence that showed that the relationship between our two countries and our friendship enable us to achieve some concrete results. And this is an improvement compared where we stood a couple of weeks ago. Well, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we\u2014certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country. And I believe France will be taken to new heights under this President. He's going to be an outstanding President, one of your great Presidents. And it's an honor to call you my friend. Thank you. Thank you very much.",
    "No. No, there's not space for that. We won't permanently station. But the idea we're not going to\u2014we're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves because we have a sacred obligation in article 5 to defend those countries. They are part of NATO. We don't have that obligation relative to Ukraine, although we have great concern about what happens in Ukraine.Thank you.Maureen [Maureen Groppe], USA Today.",
    "I absolutely do not think that. I was trying to make a broader point, which is that people have been using financial regulation as an excuse to charge consumers more. Right? I mean, basically the argument they've made is, well, you know what, this hidden fee was prohibited, and so we'll find another fee to make up for it. Now, they have that right, but it's not a good practice. It's not necessarily fair to consumers. And my main goal is to make sure that we've got a consumer watchdog in place who is letting consumers know what fair practices are, making sure that transactions are transparent, and making sure that banks have to compete for customers based on the quality of their service and good prices.Now, the frustrating thing that we have right now is that you've got folks over in Congress, Republicans, who have said that they see their role as eliminating any prohibitions on any practices for financial companies. And I think that's part of the frustration that the American people feel, because they've just gone through a period in which they were seeing a bunch of hidden fees, rate hikes that they didn't know about, fine print that they could not understand. That's true for credit cards. That's true for mortgages. It contributed to overall weakness in the economy.And yes, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Government to have some oversight role to make sure that consumers are protected. So banks--and any business in America--can price their products any way they want. That's how the free market works. As long as there's transparency and accountability and consumers understand what they're getting. And there are going to be instances where a policy judgment is made that, you know what, there are certain practices that just aren't fair. And that's how the market has always operated.",
    "Well, I think it's going to. I think it's a big start. And you're right about that: Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East. And I think this is a big start. It's going to be a very strong start, very powerful start, and it's something that I will tell you\u2014I've told David, and I've told every one of our negotiators: If you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, it's beyond disgraceful. It's\u2014if I had information and if I had absolute proof\u2014some of the stories that we've heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get\u2014I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn't believe. What they do to Christians in the Middle East\u2014and it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful. You're right.It's a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in\u2014for instance, U.A.E. has agreed very strongly to represent us; I think they will very well with respect to Christianity, because in the Middle East, it's not treated well. It's not treated well at all. It's treated horribly and very unfairly, and it's criminal what's happened, and that's for many, many years.I think it's a great question and very\u2014it's a very unfair situation.Please, go ahead.",
    "Yes. Well, first of all, as you know, I've always relied upon our military commanders to make the recommendations necessary to achieve the objectives we've set forth. We have added troops during\u2014twice during my Presidency\u2014obviously, in the initial move in and then we added troops to that. I've announced we're going to send in more troops. And then, of course, the Obama administration will be analyzing the situation, and it sounds like that they intend to expedite the\u2014sending more troops in.So\u2014and why do we do that? Because this is what our generals suggest we do. To answer your\u2014this is just going to be a long struggle, first of all. This doesn't end tomorrow. Ideological struggles take time. As a civil society whose firm political institutions begin to develop, extremism begins to wither; it gets marginalized, and then it withers away. And so it's going to take time. I can't tell you the troop levels we'll need; all I know is our generals said, this is what we need now. And they\u2014I listened to them, and I'm confident President-elect Obama will listen to the commanders as well. We are already very grateful to all those countries, nations who have come to help Afghanistan, and who have already helped Afghanistan. Canada is among the countries that's the frontrunner in assistance to Afghanistan. Their plans to withdraw their troops by 2011 or '12 is not in contradiction to the understanding that we have with them. They will continue to assist us in various other forms in Afghanistan.What is important here is that while we are continuing to fight terrorism and to bring the institutional strength and stability to Afghanistan, with an improved economy and improved governance and service delivery by the Government, we also work on enabling Afghanistan to eventually stand on its own feet. The Afghan people don't want to be a burden on the international community forever. And we are grateful already that the international community is helping us in blood and their taxpayers' money.We are grateful to Canada. We are grateful to all other countries, as partners for building Afghanistan, for fighting terrorists who are the enemies of all of us. So we are happy in any form of assistance other countries give us and will be grateful for it.One\u2014pick up one more question, Mr. President? You'd like to continue? All those who want another question, raise your hand. [] I guess so, Mr. President.[] Hold on a second.[] I respectfully disagree with you. The Taliban was brutalizing the people of Afghanistan. And they're not in power. And I just cited the progress that is undeniable.Now, is there more work to be done? You bet. I never said the Taliban was eliminated; I said they were removed from power. And I said girls are going back to school, and boys are flying kites, and health clinics are opening, and the number of university students is dramatically expanding, and the number of schools around the country is growing, and there's a ring road built. Yes, there's no question there's a Taliban that wants to fight back. Why? Because they want to regain power. They can't stand the thought of a free society. And they're lethal, and they are tough. No question about it, no question about it.So therefore, is the suggestion because they're tough that we just withdraw, that it's too hard work? Not as far as I'm concerned. I think it's necessary work. And it's in the interest of the United States that we not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven again for Al Qaida. Al Qaida is greatly weakened since 2001. As a matter of fact, they at one point declared the most central front in the war on terror in Iraq, where they're doing very poorly.And they're not doing so well here either. Now, they can hide in remote regions. They can hide, but we will stay on the hunt, and we will keep the pressure on them, because it's in the people\u2014the peaceful people of Afghanistan's interest, just like it's in the interest of this country.And so is there still difficult days ahead? Absolutely. But are the conditions a lot better today in Afghanistan than they were in 2001? Unquestionably, undoubtedly, they're better.[] Mr. President. Steven Lee [Steven Lee Myers, New York Times].",
    "I will not be rendering judgment about individual orientation. I do believe the don't ask, don't tell policy is good policy.Sammon [Bill Sammon, Washington Times], yes.",
    "Do you believe Americans see it in their interest to help Africa? Yes. I might try to help you out on the last question. America is wealthy enough to do both.There was a victory for the people of Pakistan, and that is, there were elections held that have been judged as being fair. And the people have spoken. I view that as a significant victory. I view it as a part of the victory in the war on terror. After all, ideologues can't stand\u2014like these guys we're dealing with\u2014can't stand free societies. That's why they try to kill innocent people. That's why they tried to intimidate people during the election process.And so I'm\u2014I appreciate the fact that President Musharraf has done exactly that which he said he was going to do. He said he'd hold elections; he said he would get rid of his emergency law. And so it's now time for the newly elected folks to show up and form their Government. And the question then is, will they be friends of the United States? And I certainly hope so.We view Pakistan as an important ally. We've got common interests. We've got interests in dealing with radicals who killed Benazir Bhutto. We've got interests in helping make sure there's no safe haven from which people can plot and plan attacks against the United States of America and Pakistan. And so that's my take on the elections. Thank you, and whether American interests coincides with African interests, I would say, yes. Yes. One should ask what the whole idea of the United States is about. The U.S. is a melting pot of all the races and nationalities of the world. Your country has a large content of African Americans, so that I would expect that constituency of Africa\u2014and incidentally, the African Union has itemized the people of African descent as the sixth region of Africa. And so we look on the African Americans as our kith and kin, and they constitute a sizeable constituency in the United States. It should be in their interest to support any help the United States can extend to Africa. That's one.Two, we are all moving into a global village, and problems overspill easily, especially with the free movements of people and trade, so that if the United States should lock itself into isolationism and think they are safer there, then I would say, perhaps they don't know what is coming, because global village is a reality. Migration cannot be stopped, and if you do not help, then the vibrant youth of Africa, driven by the technological age forces\u2014they watch television, the Internet, and so forth\u2014they want to move and see what's happening around the world. They will come to you, and if you do not help us to prepare this youth, then whatever youth would land on your shores would come with all the roughness, the hurry, and that would be your headache.So I believe it's enlightenment for the United States Government to want to support them here. And then we talk terrorism, which has no bounds. As evidence, when the 9/11 happened in your country, it wasn't only Americans who became victims; some Ghanaians died in that event, and shows we have common interests somewhere. So these and other factors should account for why the United States, perhaps industrially and otherwise the most advanced country in the world, should be concerned about the plight of other peoples. Thank you.",

I watched one, sort of, fairly recently\u2014not too long ago\u2014go into a cabin, lock himself into a cabin, and he came out, and he wasn't very effective. You know, he had so much\u2014so many things going on. Sometimes, you can go too much in that stuff, you know. Sometimes, you can go too much.I mean, look, I've had\u2014I'd never debated before, but then I debated a lot 4 years ago. And if you look at the polls\u2014those polls that come out\u2014hundreds of thousands of people in TIME magazine and all of the different polls; I think there's about seven or eight of them\u2014according to those polls, I won every debate\u2014every single debate, in the primaries and then when I debated Crooked Hillary. I won every debate.I mean, this isn't me saying\u2014I felt I did\u2014but this isn't me saying it; this is the polls. You had a TIME magazine poll. You had this, that. And I guess they take them off the internet or they get phone calls or something. But according to that, I won every debate, and I felt I did. But I understand the subject. Now, Chris is tough. I hope that Chris is going to be equally tough on Joe Biden. But I watched the young lady, who I won't\u2014I won't say her name, but it was embarrassing the way she was getting him along.So I just asked the question about drugs.

    "No. It's got to include the wall. We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety. We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in. I would imagine that the people in the room, both Democrat and Republican, I really believe they're going to come up with a solution to the DACA problem\u2014which has been going on for a long time\u2014and maybe, beyond that, immigration as a whole.But any solution has to include the wall, because without the wall, it all doesn't work. You could look at other instances. Look at what happened in Israel. They put up the wall; they solved the\u2014a very major problem.We need the wall. We have to have the wall for security purposes. Security is number one. And so the answer is, have to have the wall. Thank you.And please.",
    "Yes, on the bringing balance in our diplomatic approaches, this is not about our stance vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and the China. We are trying to bring a solution to the nuclear problem\u2014D.P.R.K. nuclear problem\u2014and to bring permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.And moreover, we would like to promote peace, stability, and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region. So we would like to expand our diplomatic efforts in this regard. And that should include our efforts for China, as well as ASEAN and Russia and the EU. I believe that we should diversify efforts\u2014diplomatic efforts\u2014so that we can pursue a more balanced approach. So that was the intention of making such comments.And to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and to overcome and to resolve the nuclear problem, I think there's role to be played by the United States and China. And when it comes to the United States, a very strong sanctions and pressure is being put by the United States. The U.S. is leading efforts, and I am very sure that substantive results will be realized through such efforts. And China has also faithfully implemented the U.N. resolution to impose sanctions on D.P.R.K. So we have heightened the pressure and sanctions on D.P.R.K., and I think this will also contribute to resolving the n nuclear problem.And if our international society's efforts bear fruits\u2014if such efforts bear fruits\u2014and if we can really make a turnaround, then I'm sure that we will be able to bring to the table of dialogue. And through such dialogue, I am very confident that we can freeze the nuclear program and ultimately dismantle the weapons program of the D.P.R.K. entirely. And in this, I believe that cooperation from the U.S. and China is essential.And on the establishing a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, I don't think it's the right time even that we talk about this issue. Now we should focus on bringing an end to the D.P.R.K. provocations and bringing D.P.R.K. to the table for dialogue. This is the impending challenge that we must address now. So we must focus on the sanctions and pressure. And when there is a turnaround\u2014when the turnaround finally comes\u2014then we should certainly make efforts to further consult each other\u2014Korea and the U.S.\u2014for settling peace on the Korean Peninsula. . I want to just say that President Xi\u2014where we will be tomorrow, China\u2014has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with . We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries\u2014and we know for a fact that other countries have already started. And we've had great dialogue with many other countries, as you know, and they're really helping a lot.So if we get China, if we get Russia\u2014and we have some other countries, but we want to get most of them\u2014we think that things will happen, and they could happen very quickly.This is a problem, by the way, that should have been done over the last 25 years, not now. This is not the right time to be doing it, but that's what I've got. That's what I've got. This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.Thank you. Thank you.

    "Yes, I think we're making progress in Afghanistan, but there's a very resilient enemy that obviously wants to kill people that stand in the way of their reimposition of a state that is\u2014which vision is incredibly dark. I mean, it's very important for the American people to remember what life was like in Afghanistan prior to the liberation of the country. We had a government in place that abused people's human rights. They didn't believe in women's rights, they didn't let little girls go to school, and they provided safe haven to Al Qaida. In the liberation of this country, we've achieved some very important strategic objectives: denying Al Qaida safe haven from which to plot and plan attacks and replacing this repressive group with a young democracy.And it's difficult in Afghanistan. I mean, it's\u2014if you know the history of the country, you understand it's hard to go from the kind of society in which they had been living to one in which people are now responsible for their own behavior. But I am pleased with a lot of things. One, I'm pleased with the number of roads that have been built. I'm pleased with the number of schools that have opened up. I'm pleased a lot of girls, young girls, are going to school. I'm pleased health clinics are now being distributed around the country. I'm pleased with the Afghan Army, that when they're in the fight, they're good.I wish we had completely eliminated the radicals who kill innocent people to achieve objectives, but that hasn't happened yet. And so I think it's very much in our interests to continue helping the young democracy, and we will.Yes. Obviously, you've got a follow-up.",
    "Every time there is a terrorist attack, I feel disappointment, because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention, because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered.So I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens. And we are constantly pushing ourselves to see, are there additional ideas that we can deploy to defeat this threat?Now, it is important that we recognize, terrorism as a tactic has been around for a long time. And if you look at the seventies or the eighties or the nineties, there was some terrorist activity somewhere in the world that was brutal. And as much as I would like to say that during my 8-year Presidency, we could have eliminated terrorism completely, it's not surprising that that hasn't happened, and I don't expect that will happen under the watch of my successors.I do think that because of our extraordinary efforts, the homeland is significantly safer than it otherwise would be. Now, some\u2014in some ways, this is arguing the counterfactuals, but the attacks we prevent I take great satisfaction in, and I am grateful for the extraordinary work that our teams do. I don't think there's any doubt that had we not destroyed Al aida in the FATA that more Americans would have been killed, and we might have seen more attacks like we saw on 9/11. And we have maintained vigilance, recognizing that those threats still remain, those aspirations in the minds of these folks still remain, but it is much harder for them to carry out large-scale attacks like that than it used to be.What we have seen is that these lower level attacks carried out by fewer operatives or an individual with less sophisticated and less expensive weapons can do real damage. And that, I think, points to the need for us to not just have a military strategy, not just have a traditional counterterrorism strategy that's designed to bust up networks and catch folks before they carry out their attacks\u2014although those still are necessary, and we have to be more and more sophisticated about how we carry those out; it still requires us to have much greater cooperation with our partners around the world\u2014but it points to the fact that we're going to have to do a better job in draining the ideology that is behind these attacks; that right now is emanating largely out of the Middle East and a very small fraction of the Muslim world a perversion of Islam that has taken root and has been turbocharged over the Internet; and that is appealing to even folks who don't necessarily know anything about Islam and aren't even practicing Islam in any serious way, but have all kinds of psychosis and latch on to this as some way of being important and magnifying themselves.And that's tougher because that involves both changes in geopolitics in places like Syria. It requires cultural changes in regions like the Middle East and North Africa that are going through generational changes and shifts as the old order collapses. It requires psychology and thinking about how do these messages of hate reach individuals and are there ways in which we can intervene ahead of time. And all that work is being done. And we've got the very best people at it, and each day, they're making a difference in saving lives, not just here, but around the world.But it's a challenge precisely because if you're successful 99 percent of the time, that 1 percent can still mean heartbreak for families. And it's difficult because in a country, let's say, of 300 million people here in the United States, if 99.9 percent of people are immune from this hateful ideology, but one-tenth of 1 percent are susceptible to it, that's a lot of dangerous people running around. And we can't always anticipate them ahead of time because they may not have criminal records. So this is going to be a challenge.I just want to end on the point that I made earlier. How we react to this is as important as the efforts we take to destroy ISIL, prevent these networks from penetrating. You can't separate those two things out. The reason it's called terrorism, as opposed to just a standard war, is that these are weak enemies that can't match us in conventional power, but what they can do is make us scared. And when it make\u2014and when societies get scared, they can react in ways that undermine the fabric of our society. It makes us weaker and makes us more vulnerable and creates politics that divide us in ways that hurt us over the long term.And so if we remain steady and steadfast and vigilant, but also take the long view and maintain perspective and remind ourselves of who we are and what we care about most deeply, and what we cherish and what's good about this country and what's good about the international order and civilization that was built in part because of the sacrifices of our men and women after a 20th century full of world war\u2014if we remember that\u2014then we're going to be okay. But we're still going to see, episodically, these kinds of tragedies, and we're going to have to keep working on it until we make things better. All right?",
    "We expect our NATO allies to shoulder the burden necessary to succeed. And to this end, as you know, I've committed 3,200\u20143,500 additional marines to send a clear signal that we're willing to do our part.I was very pleased to listen to the comments of President Sarkozy, where he indicated his willingness to increase troop presence. Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of\u2014 in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people\u2014nations in our alliance\u2014to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this\u2014of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it\u2014and so is the President\u2014it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region. Sure, we have a extremely clear idea if we don't keep the terrorists in Afghanistan. If we will let them free, they'll come in Europe, they'll come in United States. For this reason, we have to win; we have to obtain the victory in Afghanistan."
