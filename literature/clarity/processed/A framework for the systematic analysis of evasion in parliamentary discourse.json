This study applies and adapts various approaches on how politicians 'resist' answering questions, all of which are based on political news interviews, to the study of evasion in parliamentary discourse. A comprehensive, unified framework for the analysis of evasion is described, a decision flowchart for the framework is provided, and an illustrative example of the applied framework is given based on Australia's Question Time. It involved the classification of responses as 'answers', 'intermediate responses', and 'evasions' based on specific criteria. Responses which were considered evasions were further analysed to determine the levels of evasion, whether they were covert or overt in nature and the types of 'agenda shifts' that occurred, if any. The corpus investigated consists of Australia's House of Representatives' Question Time transcripts, for the months of February and March 2003, on the specific issue of Iraq. The study provides empirical evidence that evasion does occur during parliamentary Question Time.",

The framework combines and modifies various approaches in the study of evasion or equivocation in political broadcast interviews, for which there have only been limited studies conducted so far, and applies this to another form of political communication, Question Time. While political interviews and Question Time are arguably different generic types of discourse, there is considerable overlap, particularly in terms of the politicians' motives and strategies of evasion. Wilson (1990) , Harris (1991) , Bull and Mayer (1993) , Bull (1994) and Clayman (2001) provide useful procedures for the analysis of evasion but none offer a complete analytical framework. For instance, Wilson, Harris and Bull provide criteria for the identification of answers, intermediate answers and evasions, but do not offer procedures for the in-depth analysis of evasive responses. On the other hand, Clayman discusses various means by which evasive responses may be analysed but does not discuss criteria for identifying responses. This article provides a more comprehensive model that identifies evasive responses, the different levels at which evasion occurs, whether overt or covert practices are involved, and the types of agenda shifts in evasive responses.",

Rodan (1983) regards Australia's House of Representatives as essentially a 'talk shop'. Parliamentary talk occurs in a number of contexts which, in turn, influence the nature of parliamentary discourse. Bayley (2004) explains that a parliamentarian might talk in a cooperative and informal manner in a committee, take on an adversarial stance in a full sitting in the chamber (of which Question Time is an example), or resort to threats or promises in the corridors of Parliament.",

Van Dijk (2004) looks at parliamentary discourse in terms of its contextual properties, Bayley (2004) views parliamentary talk as a discourse model due to its distinctive characteristics whilst Harris (2001:453) argues that the House of Commons should be regarded as a community of practice, whereby new members undergo a gradual process of 'situated learning' before gaining full membership as experienced parliamentarians. Their views are part of the rapidly growing literature on parliamentary discourse, including recent studies on Iraq war discourses such as those carried out by Chouliaraki (2005) and Van Dijk (2005) which show the ongoing relevance of the present study which focuses on the Iraq issue. However, most of these studies focus on parliamentary debates and speeches. Very little analysis has been found of parliamentary Question Time discourse. Most of what is available is mainly or partly based on Britain's Prime Minister's Question Time (Wilson, 1990; Harris, 2001; Ilie, 2004; Chilton, 2004) , with both Harris' and Ilie's studies focusing on the adversarial or confrontational nature of that discourse.",

Questions without notice (asked during Question Time), in Australia's House of Representatives, are asked by Members of Parliament (MPs) and usually directed at Ministers regarding their portfolios. All Ministers are expected to be present to answer these questions. The forum is well attended by parliamentarians (Sinclair, 1982) since it ''attracts a consistently high degree of media attention'' (Kelly and Harris, 2001: 2) and is the ''most publicly-recognised event'' in Australia's Parliament (Uhr, 1982:62 ). Australia's Question Time is part of a political system based on Britain's Westminster's system. The practice of asking questions without notice evolved 'ad hoc' in Australia and its House of Representatives formally adopted Standing Orders permitting such questions in 1950 (ed. Barlin, 1997) . However, some significant differences have evolved in Australia.",

It begins with the Speaker, who is in charge of proceedings, announcing 'Questions without Notice' and then asking whether there are any questions (House of Representatives infosheet, 2002) . This is followed by members on either side (Government and Opposition MPs) standing up and seeking to attract the Speaker's attention. The first question is almost always asked by the Leader of the main Opposition party or his/her deputy, and the Speaker then calls for questions from both sides of the House (Government and Opposition) alternately (Sinclair, 1982; Solomon, 1986) . Question Time ends when the Prime Minister, or a senior Minister in the Prime Minister's absence, requests that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. These questions then become questions on notice. However, in Britain, prior notice is given to a Minister of questions that will be asked during Question Time, the exception being a special procedure (for questioning Ministers regarding urgent matters) known as the 'Private Notice Question' (House of Commons Information Office, 2003) . Otherwise all other questions, whether oral or written, are on notice. Similar practices of placing all oral questions 'on notice' have also been adopted in India and New Zealand (House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedures, 1986; Jaensch, 1992) .",

                "text": "Some rules and regulations also differ between Australia's and UK's parliamentary systems. Relevant to this study is that the only rule governing answers in Australia's Question Time is that the answers should be relevant to the questions asked (Parliament of Australia, 2006) . The rules regarding answers in the British, Indian and New Zealand Parliaments are more detailed (House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedures, 1986). However, there are similarities. Although parliamentary rules govern turn-taking procedures during Question Time, 'illegal interventions' such as ''jeering, cheering, calling out'' and laughter (Harris, 2001:462) seem to be tolerated in both the British and Australian systems. Party solidarity is expressed with each side cheering ''its own'' while jeering the ''other''. Conflicts sometimes arise during Question Time, the main reason being the adversarial nature of parliamentary discourse (Ilie, 2003; Bayley, 2004; Chilton, 2004) . Commonly known as 'point-scoring' in Australia, both sides of the House, i.e. both the Government and the Opposition, have been accused of 'attacking' each other (Henderson, 1981; Jaensch, 1984 Jaensch, , 1986 Jaensch, , 1992;; Solomon, 1986; Snell and Upcher, 2002; Uhr, 2002; Rasiah, 2006) . One form of attack is the use of questions. Questions are ''part of a political battle in which party points are scored and personal or party glory pursued'' (Borthwick, 1993:103) . Most questions asked by Opposition MPs are likely to contain a built-in hostility which often leads to evasion. Dillon (1990:154) views evasion as a ''routine strategy for responding to a question without answering it''. Many others have also commented on the widely-held view that politicians equivocate or evade answering questions (Wilson, 1990; Harris, 1991; Bull and Mayer, 1993; Bull, 1994 Bull, , 2003)) . A study on British political interviews conducted by Harris (1991) concludes that there is empirical evidence to justify this view.",

Both Question Time and political interviews involve a basic question/answer framework where questions are asked and answers are expected (Harris, 1991) . However, according to Harris (2001) and Chilton (2004) , the question/answer framework, specified by the House of Commons' Circular, is not clearly obvious in practice due to the informal and interactive nature of Question Time. There are a number of factors that can influence the questions and therefore the types and nature of responses given. Hostile Opposition questions are more likely to be evaded since they are usually closed yes/no questions containing negative presuppositions. Wilson (1990:151) states that some yes/no questions have propositional contents that make them difficult to be answered directly with 'yes' or 'no', since such answers would ''indicate acceptance of many of the propositions attached to the question''. According to Chilton (2004:64) , it requires ''effort to retrieve, formulate and challenge a presupposition''. Such questions contravene parliamentary rules, though they continue to be asked.",

Relevant to this study is the common-sense approach, as propounded by Wilson (1990) , which is basically similar to the structural approach used by Lyons (1977) . Wilson identifies two main types of questions. The first type uses interrogative forms such as who, what, where, when and how (the 'Wh-questions') and the second has forms using particular ''grammatical movement rules'' that change ''subject auxiliary positions'' (Wilson, 1990:145) , thus producing questions such as ''Is Mary X'' or ''Are they Y'' (the 'yes/no questions'). Included in the second type are those using modals such as can, could, should, will, etc. Bull (1994 Bull ( , 2003) ) also uses the structural approach for classifying questions mainly drawing on the works of Quirk et al. (1985) . Another category of questions are the 'disjunctive' questions which require a choice between two or more alternatives (Quirk et al., 1985) .",

To overcome this problem Stubbs (1983) suggested a choice from a slot in a continuum, whereby 'yes' or 'no' answers are selected from a continuum which ranges between 'yes' and 'no' and 'positive certainty' and 'negative certainty'. For example, an answer such as ''I don't think so'' lies closer to the 'no' than to the 'yes' end of the continuum (Stubbs, 1983:106) . Thus, any response to a yes/no question that provides information to the questioner, which helps him/her locate the answer within a slot in the yes/no continuum, is considered an answer. As for Wh-questions, Wilson (1990:146) describes an appropriate answer in this context as presupposing ''an unknown variable which requires a value . . . selected from any one of a number of complex sets''. A 'where' question ''must normally be followed by a place'' and a 'when' question ''by a time adverbial'' (Stubbs, 1983:107) .",

Evasive responses were further sub-categorized according to the 'level of evasion', whether 'overt or covert practices' were involved, and the 'agenda shifts' that occurred in each. The framework for the systematic analysis of evasion in the form of a flowchart (Fig. 1 ) is provided together with an in-depth analysis of an evasive response drawn from Australia's federal House of Representatives' Question Time. It is acknowledged that, in a given analysis, some of the categories described in this framework may not always present clear boundaries and can occasionally appear to overlap, thus creating difficulties for the analyst.

Responses to such questions, usually lengthy, warranted careful analysis to clarify which parts satisfied the required criteria for what could be considered an answer, an intermediate response or an evasion to each sub-question. Occasionally, responses to questions with fuzzy category boundaries, specifically those with hostile presuppositions, were categorized as 'intermediate responses' partly to give the benefit of doubt to the respondents and partly because of other factors, as explained below (refer to section 4.3.2).",

Key word(s) in a question are repeated (lexical repetition) in a response although the question remains unanswered. For example, when Crean asked Howard how long an ''interim US protectorate'' in Iraq would last, Howard repeated the word ''interim'' used in the question but evaded answering the question. Part of Howard's response was: (6) As I made clear to the House yesterday, it is a matter of practical reality that there will be an interim period immediately following the conflict in which the US will play a leadership role in the administration of Iraq-and that is proper and natural. (House Hansard, 27 March 2003:13802) In responding, Howard performed a task different from that required by the question, which was the expected duration of the interim period. Anaphoric reference or 'back referencing' has an effect similar to word repetition. One instance in this study was the use of the anaphoric reference 'those' in response to a lengthy Opposition question, as follows: (7) Plibersek: My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the UNHCR's current preparations for receiving refugees in the border regions of Syria, Jordan and Iran as a result of the conflict in Iraq? Can the Prime Minister confirm that the UNHCR has made contingency plans for receiving up to 600,000 refugees from Iraq in these areas? Can the Prime Minister advise the House of what communication his government has had with both the coalition military command and the UNHCR to provide safe passage for Iraqi civilians to border refugee camps? Ruddock: The fact is that we have been in close consultation with the UNHCR on its efforts in relation to those matters and are very aware of the contingency planning that has occurred. It is very wise for organisations like the UNHCR to be involved in contingency planning. We have been apprised of it and are very much aware of it.

Agenda shifts by Question Time respondents also included attacking the UN, its Security Council, Iraq (and its leader, Saddam Hussein), and those who held a view different to that of the Government. For example, Howard attacked Iraq and Saddam while responding to a question by Crean asking for confirmation that the ''food for oil program'' had been suspended the week earlier (refer to section 5.1.1). Howard evaded answering the question and instead blamed Iraq for the suspension, as follows: (14) [. . .] I might also take the opportunity, because the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the oil for food program, of reminding him and the parliament that the United Nations sanctions would never have been necessary if Iraq had agreed to the requirements of disarmament imposed way back in 1991. I might also say that the oil for food program has been immorally and shamefully rorted by Saddam Hussein, who has used the proceeds of it to acquire his weapons capacity and support it. It has to be said-and the Australian public should be reminded-that we had these economic sanctions because Iraq did not disarm. They were imposed by the United Nations because Iraq did not disarm. If Iraq had disarmed, those sanctions would never have been necessary. Worse still, having through his policies made those sanctions necessary, the Iraqi leader has compounded the sins inflicted upon his own people by rorting the very oil for food program which was designed to in some way mitigate the impact of the economic sanctions. So he is doubly guilty of betraying his obligations towards the Iraqi people. (House Hansard, 25 March 2003:13403) ii. Talks up one's own side Question Time respondents often made agenda shifts portraying themselves and the Government positively. Of the 27 questions asked in the month of February 2003 by the Opposition Leader, 13, i.e. almost 50%, received a response that shifted the agenda to portraying the Government in a positive light. One instance of its occurrence was when Opposition MP Gillard asked Ruddock (Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) for confirmation that in the previous year's budget ''the government cut core funding to the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, by almost 50 per cent'' and that ''the additional amount of money the Howard government is giving the UNHCR for the Iraqi crisis remains less than the amount it cut out of the UNHCR's core funding'' (House Hansard, 26 March 2003:13564) . In his response, Ruddock shifted the agenda to a positive portrayal of the previous Government actions after making a token request for permission and an attack on the questioner:",

Of course, it is not in the mind of the government of Iraq. (17) I contrast the policy of the United States government, the British government and the Australian government to the behaviour of the Iraqi regime. For example, Iraq is deliberately placing air defence and other military assets in close proximity to civilian sites in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's forces have also used a hospital at An Nasiriyah as a headquarters for the storage of arms. There are other examples where deliberate action has been taken as an instrument of war and as an instrument of political propaganda to use civilians as shields and to deliberately play upon the very legitimate and genuine humanitarian concerns of civilian populations in democracies such as Australia. (18) Some commentators have even suggested that the targeting policies of the allies in this conflict have been such as to put at greater risk the lives of defence personnel serving on behalf of the United States and the United Kingdom. ( 19) But I repeat again that unprecedented steps have been taken by the Americans, the British and by us to keep those casualties to an absolute minimum-and that is in stark contrast to the deliberate policy of the Iraqi regime to put the lives of their own civilians at risk as a political instrument and as a psychological instrument against the forces that are aligned against them. (20) Those are some of the steps we are taking. Similar steps are being taken by the British and the Americans.",

He also implied that (18) Australia and its allies' defence forces put their own lives at risk to (19) keep casualties ''to an absolute minimum'' in ''stark contrast'' to the Iraqi forces.

Several levels of evasion were observed, ranging from full evasions to subtle shifts, the most prominent being the medium level of evasion (performance of a task different from that required by the question). Various overt and covert practices were observed in the evasions. The study extends Clayman's work on overt and covert practices by identifying two further covert practices, the use of 'similar words' and the use of 'vague, general terms'. Almost all of the identified evasions involved agenda shifts, the two most prominent being to attack the Opposition and 'others' (negative other-presentation), and to 'talk up one's own side' (positive self-presentation). The sample analysis provided an example of how the analytical framework can be used.
