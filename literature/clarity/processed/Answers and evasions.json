After a preliminary examination of the practices through which answers are recognizably constructed, the analysis turns to the practices through which interviewees manage responses that resist the agenda of an interviewer's question. When resisting overtly, interviewees engage in various forms of \"damage control.\" When resisting covertly, interviewees take steps to render the resistance less conspicuous. Both sets of practices facilitate resistant responses by reducing the negative consequences that might otherwise follow. Such practices demonstrate that, although interviewees have developed practices for resisting questions, the norm of answering remains a salient feature of the contemporary broadcast news interview. (Interview, news interview, questions and answers, interrogation, broadcast talk, political communication, Conversation Analysis.)* When Albert Gore was Bill Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 1992, Gore's position on abortion became the focus of controversy. As a legislator, Gore had opposed federal funding for most abortions, but now he was expressing support for it as part of Clinton's health care reform plan. In an aggressive interview conducted by Sam Donaldson, Gore received a barrage of tough questions exposing this apparent contradiction.

On the other side of the Atlantic, a question about the Labour Party's opposition to nuclear weapons prompted party leader Neil Kinnock to give a cavalier response that was subsequently exploited by the Tories and helped ensure Thatcher's reelection in 1987. And it is not only politicians who face such dangers: no interviewee is immune. In response to a question about the absence of African Americans at the managerial level in professional baseball, Al Campanis, vice president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, made some racially insensitive remarks which caused such an uproar that he was fired the next day. To avoid consequences like these, interviewees may be motivated to be less than forthcoming in the face of hostile questioning.",

When Clinton administration Treasury secretary Robert Rubin sidestepped a difficult question about gasoline taxes and instead offered a rosy analysis of the overall economy, he was reprimanded for his slipperiness: \"When we ask people like you a simple question . . . you do the light fantastic instead of giving us a direct answer.\" Sanctions like these, in addition to upping the ante for a genuine answer, also constitute the previous response as indeed evasive, thereby exposing and highlighting that quality for the broadcast audience. Interviewers have not always been quite so aggressive, but the impetus to monitor for and respond to evasiveness is now rooted in the adversarial culture of contemporary American journalism (Clayman and Heritage in press a) . Journalistinterviewers gain professional status on the basis of aggressive questioning, and they pride themselves on the skill with which they can pursue and pin down recalcitrant interviewees. 2 Monitoring by journalists can also extend beyond the occasion of the interview itself. Subsequent news stories about interviews and press conferences often contain excerpts (in the form of quotations and sound bites) that show public figures to be refusing to answer questions, or initially resisting questions, or answering only after being repeatedly pressed to do so (Clayman 1990) . When Texas governor George W. Bush, early in his 2000 campaign for the presidency, gave less than forthcoming answers to questions about his cocaine use, there followed a virtual feeding frenzy of stories dissecting the ramifications of his evasiveness. A similar fate befell President Bill Clinton following his artful responses to questions about Monica Lewinsky. An act of evasion can thus become a newsworthy event in its own right, and a persistent source of unfavorable publicity.",

In the organization of interactional sequences, answers are responsive actions that become relevant only on the completion of a question, and questions in turn set an agenda of topics and tasks to be dealt with in subsequent talk (Heritage in press) . Moreover, after a question has been produced, interactants monitor the ensuing talk to determine how it embodies an answer to the question (Schegloff 1968 (Schegloff , 1972)) . What, then, constitutes an answer in this context? This may at first seem obvious: an answer is an action that addresses the agenda of topics and tasks posed by a previous question. What is less obvious is precisely how such responsiveness is displayed by interviewees (henceforth IEs) and recognized by interviewers (henceforth IRs) and members of the audience, in actual practice. This puzzle is complicated by the fact that there is no single primary indicator or marker of \"answering\" -unlike \"questioning,\" which is typically marked by interrogative syntax. How, then, do IEs indicate that they are indeed being responsive to the question at hand? In other words, how do they accomplish or do \"answering\"?",

Instead of talking about the advantages of workfare, he begins by attacking the current unemployment program as \"ludicrous\" (lines 3-7), and he then goes on to say that reducing benefits is not a viable solution (lines 7-10).

Indeed, the initial assessment of alternatives to workfare is a relevant prelude to rendering a comparative assessment of workfare itself. Thus, considered holistically, this entire turn can be seen as occupied with the task of answering the question. And IRs generally treat such roundabout answers, once completed, as adequate. However, IRs do not in the first instance encounter completed turns; they monitor and evaluate turns incrementally, while they are unfolding. From that in-progress vantage point, the subsequent trajectory of a response may be decidedly uncertain. In the previous example, the IE could simply have attacked the alternatives without ever advancing an affirmative argument for workfare. To hear a roundabout response-in-progress as building toward a genuine answer to the question thus requires an interpretive leap of sorts. This is a leap that IRs are not always willing to make. Thus, roundabout answers are initially vulnerable to being heard as evasive and are subject to countermeasures from the IR. Consider ex. ( 2), an excerpt from a 1985 interview with Pat Buchanan, shortly after he began serving as President Reagan's second-term director of communications. The IR rather delicately makes the point (lines 2-6) that other administration officials don't seem to like Buchanan very much and have leaked that view to the press, and he goes on to ask Buchanan (line 7) how that can happen. Buchanan responds (lines 9-11) by noting that there was a lotta that in the first term, and he begins to explain why. This could be the first component of a roundabout answer that will eventually deal with the current situation, but it could also be an effort by Buchanan to deflect the discussion away from himself. The IR takes the skeptical view, analyzing it as an incipient evasion; he interjects at line 12 (arrowed), pointing out that you weren't in in the first term, thereby treating Buchanan's turn-thus-far as irrelevant and unresponsive. A more common type of trajectory establishes the \"answering\" character of the talk early on. This trajectory may be termed minimal answer plus elaboration; it begins with a first unit of talk in response that provides the information targeted by the question, albeit in a minimal way, followed by subsequent talk that clarifies and elaborates. For instance, a yes0no question can prompt an initial one-sentence expression of affirmation or negation before that answer is elaborated. An explicit \"yes\" or \"no\" may be included in the initial response, which is the normative way of answering a yes0no question (Raymond 1998) . For example: tch .hh Are you willing (.) personally to renounce the violence (.) in that country. (0.6) AB: r .hh Yes I will.",

The IR seeks to disallow this qualifying adjective by asking about any use whatsoever (line 5), but the IE again qualifies his response but in a different way (6-8), this time denying only that there was offensive use. When the IR tries to disallow that qualification (10-11), the IE switches back to his previous qualifying adjective, restricting his denial to widespread exposure (13-14). This maneuver is countered more aggressively by the IR, who interjects his next pursuit just after the qualifying adjective is introduced and before the IE has reached a possible completion point (14-15). He makes one last attempt to elicit a blanket denial, but the IE holds fast to his more cautious position (17-21). The deputy secretary's caution is not difficult to understand: any confirmation would presumably expose the government to numerous lawsuits, while a flat denial may be unsupportable and may even contradict current or future evidence. He manages to avoid both alternatives repeatedly, and in a rather subtle way. He presents himself as if he were being dutifully responsive, but in each case he winds up denying a proposition that is narrower in scope than the one posed by the original question. Finally, even responses that do address the agenda of the question, but contain additional turn components that shift away from that agenda (as in exx. [18] [19] [20] ), are treated as problematic in the news interview context (Greatbatch 1986b) . This is a product of the distinctive turn-taking system that organizes news interview talk, which obligates IEs to restrict themselves to the action of answering IRs' questions (Greatbatch 1988 , Heritage & Greatbatch 1991) . Given this normative constraint on IEs' talk, any attempt to produce something other than an answereven as a supplement to an otherwise responsive answer -may be regarded as an improper diversion from the agenda at hand.",

She prefaces this agenda shift with a request-like object, can I also point out (arrowed). ( 20 Notice that the IR makes no attempt either to grant or to refuse permission, and the IE does not seem to expect a response. Indeed, she actively discourages a response by building her token request as an incomplete clausal unit (can I also point out that . . .), which projects further talk to come. Because they provide so little opportunity for response, token requests are somewhat less deferential than their full-fledged counterparts. Nevertheless, they do show the IE to be \"going through the motions\" of seeking permission, thereby continuing at least to acknowledge the principle that it is the IR who normally sets the agenda. Whether they are \"genuine\" or \"pro forma,\" requests for permission openly acknowledge the fact that an agenda shift is being contemplated. At the same time, however, these practices alleviate some of the interpersonal damage that an agenda shift can cause. Agenda shifts constitute, among other things, a threat to the IR's control over the course of the discussion.

In the response, the difference refers to a distinction between two interpretations -by the press vs. by Scargill -of Scargill's ideology in particular. This semantic shift in the meaning and reference of the difference is part and parcel of a more encompassing shift in the agenda. Scargill veers away from the question per se in order to counter a presupposition that was embedded within it -that he is in fact a Marxist.

But IEs also may operate on a component of the question -a phrase, a prefatory statement, or one part of a multi-part question. In ex. (44), from a Nixon press conference during the Watergate period, Nixon targets the first part of a two-part question for reformulation. The journalist first asks (beginning at arrow 1) whether Nixon is personally investigating charges that his campaign funds were mishandled, and he then asks (arrow 2) whether the charges will hurt his bid for reelection. After a prefatory remark, Nixon produces a reformulation (arrow 3) that highlights the first part of the question: This reformulation is subversive in two respects. First, it replaces a key term from the question that implied wrongdoing (mishandling) with a more favorable term (handling). Furthermore, the remainder of the response deals exclusively with the matter of the investigation; Nixon never gets around to the second part of the question, regarding the consequences for his reelection campaign. This omission may not have been accidental. Dealing with the investigation question enables Nixon to present himself as \"doing something\" about a scandal within his administration, and thus independent of the morally tainted forces which brought it about. In contrast, the issue of whether the scandal will hurt his campaign seems, at least from his standpoint, less advantageous. Although this omission is clear in retrospect, it was not evident at the outset that some form of evasion was in progress. Nixon could have gone on to answer the second question. Indeed, it is standard practice for IEs, when \"reaching back\" to deal with something other than the last component of the questioning turn, to indicate as much by referring to or reformulating that aspect of the question (Clayman 1993) . This is because IEs normally address the final component of the question (Sacks 1987) ; conversely, they take steps to warn listeners when an atypical response trajectory is in the offing. Thus, Nixon's operation was initially accountable as an effort to manage an atypical response trajectory rather than to avoid the second question.",

This is reformulated in the statement of disagreement as a question about whether U.S. policy is an incorrect approach. The latter version is very much easier for the IE to refute. It is difficult to argue with the original assertion that U.S. policy has not worked, since at the time of the interview apartheid remained intact.

(47), after a full round of questioning from the other panelists, Hume regains the floor and pointedly pursues the question (line 6). Before doing so, however, he carefully justifies this move by calling attention to the inadequacy of Quayle's previous response, summarizing it in a way that highlights its feebleness: You 'n the people 'n the advisors to the President, (.) are 13 called in, (0.2) an I'll talk to 'em. . . This rejection is consequential; Quayle subsequently abandons the incipient agenda shift and returns to the original agenda (lines 7-8). Brokaw nods approvingly (9), and Quayle proceeds to elaborate on his emergency plan. Thus, while Quayle initially steers the question in a different direction, Brokaw steers him right back. However, Quayle's return to the original agenda is made to appear as if it is unrelated to what Brokaw has done. Notice that Quayle does not respond immediately to the headshakes; he continues to speak through the headshaking until the reformulation is possibly complete (line 5). He also places some distance between the completion of the headshakes and the start of his continuation, allowing one full second of silence to elapse, and then backtracking a bit when he continues (7). Furthermore, when he finally gets to the plan of action component of the reformulation, he links it to the previous component with and; it is thus introduced as a supplementary rather than a contrastive matter. By these various means, Quayle constructs his reformulation so that it can be seen as a single continuous action rather than an \"about-face\" in response to Brokaw's prompting. In other words, he presents himself as if he had been headed in this direction all along.",

He repeatedly returns to the same basic theme -qualifications and experience -as a favored response to various kinds of questions (see also ex. [42] ).

Thus, while he fosters the impression of having categorically denied an affair, on closer analysis it becomes apparent that he never quite does so in the here-and-now, on his own accord. He adopts an interactional footing in which he is merely relaying denials previously expressed by himself and others. This interview went over well at the time, and Clinton would go on to win both the nomination and the election decisively. But his performance would eventually come back to haunt him.

When resistance is done overtly, interviewees take steps to control the damage that may be caused thereby. When it is done covertly, there are corresponding efforts to conceal the resistance or at least to render it less conspicuous.

Bull 1994) . Moreover, these variations may have nontrivial consequences for how the public forms judgments about a politician's moral character. To take just one example, a skillfully managed covert approach could enable a politician to get through a hostile interrogation without any negative repercussions. Alternatively, as the case of Bill Clinton aptly demonstrates, if covert evasions are exposed by subsequent events, the politician may be seen in retrospect as devious and manipulative, and this outcome may be worse for the politician than if he or she had initially acted overtly with appropriate forms of damage control.

                "text": "said you'd say a prayer, and you said something about a meeting (4-5). He then presses Quayle to elaborate (6) . Notice that some audience members in the hall begin to laugh at this point (8), displaying appreciation of Hume's derisive commentary and aligning with him in his pursuit of an answer.(47) US, 5 Oct. 1988, Bentsen- or the responsibilities of the president of this country, 15(1.0) would I be capable and qualified (0.2) to do that. 16 (0.5) .hh and I've tried (0.4) to list the qualifications. 17(1.0) of twel:ve year:s in the United States Congress. . . .But that answer remains elusive, as Quayle again sidesteps the question, although his method of doing so here is rather different. Given that his prior covert maneuver has been exposed by Hume's pursuit, Quayle now chooses a more overt mode of resistance. He explicitly justifies his failure to provide a more substantial answer by characterizing the focus of inquiry as a hypothetical situation and suggesting that it would be improper to answer in specifics (lines 9-11). He then shifts the agenda (12-15) in precisely the same direction as before -away from his plan of action and toward his overall qualifications for the presidency. Thus, while Quayle's resistance is now overt and on record, it is also justified and accounted for.Unfortunately for Quayle, justificatory accounts do not necessarily bring the line of questioning to a halt; such accounts can be argued with and contested. This is what the very next questioner on the panel -Tom Brokaw of NBC News -does, relinquishing whatever question he had planned to asked in order to pursue the succession question yet again. In ex. ( 48), Brokaw begins with a disclaimer to the effect that that he doesn't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound left in it (lines 1-2). He then takes issue with Quayle's account for not answering (that it is a hypothetical situation), pointing out that it is after all the reason that we're here tonight (4-5). He concludes not with an interrogatively formatted question but with a pointed assertion (12-16) that surely you must have some plan in mind for assuming the presidency in an emergency, since it has happened to so many vice presidents in recent years. By rejecting Quayle's previous account for not answering, and by pressing the issue in a more pointed way, Brokaw has increased the pressure for a genuine response. After commenting on the number of times he's had this question (lines 19-22), Quayle promises to try to answer it again for you as clearly as I can (23-24). Quayle then does something that is very puzzling on its face. He launches into yet another question reformulation (beginning at arrow 1) that begins to reframe the issue once again as a matter of qualifications. However, in the course of this reformulation, he backtracks a bit (arrow 2), and then he returns to the original subject of inquiry (arrow 3) -his plan of action for taking charge of the presidency, which he subsequently elaborates (30-34). Why does Quayle start to veer away from the agenda of the question, only to return to it subsequently?The solution to this puzzle lies at the nonvocal level. After Quayle launches into his reformulation (at line 3 in ex. [49] ) and completes the focal word qualifications (4), Brokaw begins shaking his head (6), and he continues to do so until the reformulation reaches a first possible completion point. In this way, Brokaw nonvocally rejects Quayle's bid to shift the agenda.accepting it and building on it, conveys a modicum of independence from the prior course of questioning, and is thus useful in resistant and hostile environments. 4 Notice that the IE refers to the IR by name (\"Mister Day\") as he launches his resistant response. It turns out that this is a highly recurrent practice across various forms of resistance. It appears to be related to the pragmatics of address term usage in interaction generally: Speakers often address their recipients by name when expressing deeply felt opinions and personal feelings (Clayman 1998) , particularly when such opinions or feelings are oppositional in character.5 Such multi-part questions are more common in press conferences than in news interviews. 6 This excerpt is from a taped interview segment on 60 Minutes, and it appears to have been edited in such a way as to highlight and sharpen the tug-of-war between the IR and Deutch.7 Similar requests for permission and token requests are used by IEs when speaking out of turn (Greatbatch 1988) . Such practices generally serve to mitigate departures from the normative turntaking arrangements in the news interview, and agenda shifts represent a specific type of departure that is mitigated in this way. 8 The array of refusal accounts discussed here may not be equally available to all IEs in all circumstances.",
