In the context of televised interviews, there is now a substantive body of research focussed on equivocation by politicians (Harris, 1991; Bull and Mayer, 1993; Clayman, 2001; Clayman and Heritage, 2002; Bull, 2003) . However, a comparable research literature on equivocation by PMs in PMQs is still lacking. In this context, the main aim of this study was to test whether a typology devised for the analysis of equivocation in broadcast political interviews (Bull and Mayer, 1993; Bull, 1994 Bull, , 2003 Bull, , 2009) ) could be usefully extended to the analysis of prime ministerial evasiveness in PMQs. Based on the 23 sessions of PMQs held during Theresa May's first term of office (July 2016 to April 2017), the specific focus was on both the extent to which the PM fails to answer questions, and the various means by which this is accomplished.",

These conventions are enforced by the Speaker, who may ask a Member to withdraw an objectionable utterance. Historically, Speakers have objected to the use of abusive epithets such as blackguard, coward, git, guttersnipe, hooligan, rat, swine, traitor, and stoolpigeon (House of Commons Information Office, 2010).

(2014) , but included the latter sessions of their premierships as well as those at the start (in total, 120 question-response sequences for each PM). Of the five PMs, David Cameron had the highest proportion of personal attacks in his responses to questions (60%), significantly more than each of the four PMs who preceded him. Comparable figures for his predecessors were: Margaret Thatcher 24%; John Major 30%; Tony Blair 24%; and Gordon Brown 38%. From these results, personal attacks can be seen to be very much a feature of PMQs discourse. This adversarial discourse is not well received by the public, according to the results of a study of public attitudes published by the Hansard Society ('Tuned in or Turned off: Public Attitudes to Prime Minister's Questions', Allen et al., 2014) . This study was based on online focus groups, and an opinion poll (Audit of Political Engagement) posed to a representative sample of 1, 286 UK adults. Across the focus groups, there was a strong reaction to PMQs as 'childish'. The interaction between the politicians-likened by some to badly behaved children in a playground-was considered uncivilised and disrespectful. Overall, the process was described as 'pointless', a 'waste of time', and an exercise in 'futility'. Many of the respondents were infuriated by a perceived failure to answer a 'straight question', combined with scoring party points. This audit of political engagement showed that although some people liked the tone and format of PMQs, they were in a minority; for the majority of the respondents, the observed behaviour of MPs at PMQs fostered negative perceptions of Parliament, and damaged its reputation. So, for example, in response to the statement 'There is too much party political point-scoring instead of answering the question', 67% of people agreed, and only 5% disagreed (28% 'don't know').",

In the analysis of equivocation in political interviews, a coding procedure for identifying questions, replies and non-replies has been devised by the author (Bull, 1994 (Bull, , 2003 (Bull, , 2009)) , according to which it is possible to calculate what is termed reply rate. This simply refers to the proportion of questions that receive an explicit reply, defined as a response where politician provides the information requested in the question: the lower the reply rate, the more equivocal the politician. Using this coding procedure, analyses of 33 interviews conducted with British party political leaders (broadcast between 1987 and 1992) showed a mean reply rate of just 46% (Bull, 1994) . An independent study of a completely different set of interviews with Margaret Thatcher and Labour leader Neil Kinnock showed a mean reply rate of only 39% (Harris, 1991) . A more recent study, based on the 2015 and 2017 British general elections, was conducted of 26 interviews with leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) (Waddle and Bull, 2019) . Overall, the results showed reply rates comparable with those cited by Bull (1994) , with a mean of 38% (2015 general election 43%; 2017 general election 34%). Notably, however, reply rates for Theresa May were much lower. A rate of just 27% was found across two interviews given by May shortly after became PM (13 July 2016 , Bull, 2016) . A further analysis of four interviews from the 2017 British general election (Bull, 2017) found a rate of 27% for May (28% for Corbyn).",

This typology was later extended to include three new categories (Bull, 2003) . One was superordinate, termed literalism, in which a question is taken literally (and not in the sense in which it was clearly intended) as a means of not giving a reply. The other two were subcategories of the superordinate category declines to answer. These were termed pleading ignorance (saying 'I don't know' in response to a question), and the deferred reply (the politician is unable to answer the question for the present time). In total, the revised version of the equivocation typology lists 35 forms of non-reply (Bull, 2003) (see 'Methods' section for further details).",

Again, 8 of the 11 superordinate categories were found to be applicable to the responses of both the Chinese and Americans. In addition, their strategies were grouped into two higher-order constructs of covert and overt practices. In an overt response, the equivocation is quite open (e.g. in declining to answer a question), whereas in a covert response, the equivocation is not explicitly acknowledged, or may even be concealed (Clayman, 2001; Clayman and Heritage, 2002) . Overall, it was found that the Chinese spokespersons tended to use more covert practices, the Americans more overt practices. Thus, the above findings demonstrate that the original version of the typology (Bull and Mayer, 1993) has already been utilised to analyse equivocation in different political contexts in different countries (Weilin and Xiaoying, 2008; Rasiah, 2010; Cakir et al., 2016) . Accordingly, it seemed highly likely that it could be usefully extended to the analysis of equivocation in PMQs in the UK, the main focus of this study. Especial consideration was given as to whether any new categories should be introduced to the typology to categorise different types of equivocation in this particular political context, and to whether Theresa May has a distinctive equivocation style.",

In addition, different forms of equivocation were categorised in terms of the equivocation typology (Bull and Mayer, 1993; Bull, 2003) . The coding for both procedures was carried out by the two authors working independently. Any disagreements were subsequently resolved by discussion at faceto-face meetings. Previously, a reliability study had been conducted in which the first author of this article and another scorer independently coded two interviews (Bull, 1994) . Reliability was assessed for both the coding of questions, replies and nonreplies, and for the superordinate categories of the equivocation coding system (Bull and Mayer, 1993) . The results, using Cohen's (1960) kappa, showed k \u00bc 0.82 on the scoring of question-replies/non-replies, and k \u00bc 0.75 on the superordinate categories of the equivocation typology.

If questions are defined grammatically, that is, questions are those utterances that take interrogative syntax, then there is no problem. Interrogative syntax is defined as either to subject-verb inversion (e.g. 'Are you going out tonight?', and/or the use of a question word (what, when, why, who, which, where, how)). However, if questions are defined functionally as requests for information, then they do not necessarily require interrogative syntax. For example, declarative questions are identical in form to declarative statements, except for the final rising question intonation (e.g. 'You realise what the risks are?'; 'They've spoken to be ambassador, of course?'). Indeed, some declarative questions may not even be accompanied by rising intonation, although the function of the utterance is still clearly to request information (Quirk et al., 1985) .",

Alternative questions (sometimes also referred to as disjunctive questions) are those that expect as the reply one of two or more options presented in the question (e.g. 'Would you like to go for a walk or stay at home?'). Interrogative word questions are those that typically expect a reply from an open range of replies (e.g. 'What is your name?' or 'When are you going out?'); they are sometimes also referred to as wh-questions, since they typically begin with wh- (Quirk et al., 1985) .

Indirect questions are a means of asking a question through reporting that of another. These three non-interrogative syntax types of question might seem to present a problem for the guidelines as to what constitutes an answer to an interrogative syntax question. However, as Harris (1991) points out, since moodless and declarative utterances are typically put forward for agreement or disagreement by the interviewee, they can for the most part be regarded as polar questions. To test Harris' hypothesis, an analysis was conducted of all the non-interrogative type questions (N \u00bc 223) in a data set of 33 televised British political interviews broadcast between 1987 and 1992 (Bull, 2003) . This showed that 92% of these questions could be regarded as polar, the remainder as either disjunctive or interrogative word. Thus, the guidelines for answering interrogative syntax questions could easily be extended to include the three types of non-interrogative question listed in Table 1 .",

But I am also clear that the vote of the British people said that we should control the movement of people from the EU into the UK, and, unlike the right hon. Gentleman, we believe we should deliver on what the British people want. Theresa May's response is quite unclear. European Union single market rules require the free movement from one EU member country to another of goods, people, services and capital, the so-called 'four freedoms'. However, while May talks about 'maximum possible access to the European market', she also states that 'we should control the movement of people from the EU into the UK'. Given that May neither affirms nor denies whether access to the single market is a red line for the government, this response is regarded as a non-reply, although at the same time she seems to imply that she has already answered this question.",

May then went on to respond to her own version of the question (should there be a second referendum?), not the one posed by Marr. Thus, she stated, '. . . . I think if you look at some of the results that are now coming out of polling in Scotland, they suggest that the Scottish people don't want there to be a second referendum'.

Again, in PMQs (unlike political interviews), there is also always an audience of other politicians, notorious for their vociferous comments and barracking. Furthermore, whereas in PMQs the PM is effectively moderated by the Speaker, in television interviews the interaction is regulated only by the interviewer. Nevertheless, it is notable that even when Jeremy Corbyn posed questions sourced from members of the public, this had no statistically significant effect on the reply rate (23% as opposed to 20% for non-public questions), although of course it was still the LO who was putting the actual question to the PM.

Although as acknowledged above, broadcast interviews differ markedly from PMQs, it scarcely seems surprising that in both situations the politicians equivocate most frequently through making political points.

In giving a non-specific response to a specific question, it has been argued above that May is modifying the question, and then answering her own version of it. This is perhaps the most covert of all four techniques, because thereby May seemingly gives the impression of answering the question, but not to the question that has actually been posed. Thus, all four of the techniques of equivocation listed above may be regarded as covert.",

Indeed, there were respondents who described the whole the process as 'pointless', a 'waste of time' and an exercise in 'futility'. The results of the analysis reported here confirm these public perceptions. In 23 sessions of PMQs, not only did May answer on average only 11% of the questions from the LO, but also used a variety of covert techniques to equivocate, thereby failing to maintain any semblance of dialogue with her opposite number. Thus, the study provides ample empirical evidence to substantiate public perceptions and their gross dissatisfaction with the dialogue (or lack of it) in PMQs.",

                "text": "From a wider perspective, equivocation is politically important if it infuriates the public, and potentially turns them off politics, when voter apathy and poor electoral turnouts are recognised as serious problems for an effectively functioning democratic system. Equivocation is also important because of its potential to undermine political accountability, if at this showpiece parliamentary event the PM persistently avoids answering questions from the LO. Of course, in this respect it is also important to consider the quality of questioning. Notably, the LO is permitted to ask up to six questions at each session of PMQs, thereby equivocation by the PM can be followed up in subsequent questions, which of course is not possible for other MPs, who are permitted only one question. How successfully this is accomplished is of course another issue. This would certainly merit future investigation, with a particular focus on how the LO follows up equivocation from the PM, and on the relative effectiveness of different types of followup. More broadly, the identification of different forms of equivocation through the typology reviewed above may provide useful cues to posing more challenging and penetrating questions in PMQs-thereby to improve its political accountability, and hence to provide more effective parliamentary scrutiny.",
