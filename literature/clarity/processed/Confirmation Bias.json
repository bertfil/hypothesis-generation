(Evans, 1989, p. 41) If one were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration. Many have written about this bias, and it appears to be sufficiently strong and pervasive that one is led to wonder whether the bias, by itself, might account for a significant fraction of the disputes, altercations, and misunderstandings that occur among individuals, groups, and nations.",

The prosecutor tries to marshal evidence to support the contention that a crime has been committed; the defense attorney tries to present evidence that will support the presumption that the defendant is innocent. Neither is committed to an unbiased weighing of all the evidence at hand, but each is motivated to confirm a particular position.

The line between deliberate selectivity in the use of evidence and unwitting molding of facts to fit hypotheses or beliefs is a difficult one to draw in practice, but the distinction is meaningful conceptually, and confirmation bias has more to do with the latter than with the former.

A large literature has grown up around these and similar puzzles and paradoxes. Here this controversy is largely ignored. It is sufficiently clear for the purposes of this discussion that, as used in everyday language, confirmation connotes evidence that is perceived to support-to increase the credibility of-a hypothesis.",

People may treat evidence in a biased way when they are motivated by the desire to defend beliefs that they wish to maintain. (As already noted, this is not to suggest intentional mistreatment of evidence; one may be selective in seeking or interpreting evidence that pertains to a belief without being deliberately so, or even necessarily being aware of the selectivity.) But people also may proceed in a biased fashion even in the testing of hypotheses or claims in which they have no material stake or obvious personal interest. The former case is easier to understand in commonsense terms than the latter because one can appreciate the tendency to treat evidence selectively when a valued belief is at risk. But it is less apparent why people should be partial in their uses of evidence when they are indifferent to the answer to a question in hand. An adequate account of the confirmation bias must encompass both cases because the existence of each is well documented.",

An observation that is consistent with more than one hypothesis is said not to be diagnostic with respect to those hypotheses; when one considers the probability of an observation conditional on only a single hypothesis, one has no way of determining whether the observation is diagnostic.",

Participants in the study by Perkins, Farady, and Bushey were capable of generating reasons for holding a view counter to their own when explicitly asked to do so; this finding led Tishman, Jay, and Perkins (1993) to interpret the failure to do so spontaneously as a motivational problem as distinct from a cognitive limitation. Baron (1995) found that, when asked to judge the quality of arguments, many people were likely to rate one-sided arguments higher than two-sided arguments, suggesting that the bias is at least partially due to common beliefs about what makes an argument strong. In keeping with this result, participants in a mock jury trial who tended to use evidence selectively to build one view of what happened expressed greater confidence in their decisions than did those who spontaneously tried to weigh both sides of the case (D. Kuhn, Weinstock, & Flaton, 1994) .",

Some of Kuhn's participants were unable to indicate what evidence would be inconsistent with their theories; some were able to generate alternative theories when asked, but they did not do so spontaneously.

Some studies demonstrating selective testing behavior of this sort involved a task invented by Wason (1960) in which people were asked to find the rule that was used to generate specified triplets of numbers. The experimenter presented a triplet, and the participant hypothesized the rule that produced it. The participant then tested the hypothesis by suggesting additional triplets and being told, in each case, whether it was consistent with the rule to be discovered. People typically tested hypothesized rules by producing only triplets that were consistent with them. Because in most cases they did not generate any test items that were inconsistent with the hypothesized rule, they precluded themselves from discovering that it was incorrect if the triplets it prescribed constituted a subset of those prescribed by the actual rule. Given the triplet 2-4-6, for example, people were likely to come up with the hypothesis successive even numbers and then proceed to test this hypothesis by generating additional sets of successive even numbers. If the 2-4-6 set had actually been produced by the rule numbers increasing by 2, numbers increasing in size, or any three positive numbers, the strategy of using only sets of successive even numbers would not reveal the incorrectness of the hypothesis because every test item would get a positive response.",

The results this endeavor will yield will, at best, be consistent with the hypothesis, but the confirmatory evidence they provide will not be as compelling as would the failure of a rigorous attempt at disconfirmation. This point is worth emphasizing because the psychological literature contains many references to the confirmatory feedback a participant gets when testing a hypothesis with a positive case. These references do not generally distinguish between confirmatory in a logical sense and confirmatory in a psychological sense. The results obtained by Wason (1960) and others suggest that feedback that is typically interpreted by participants to be strongly confirmatory often is not logically confirmatory, or at least not strongly so. The \"confirmation\" the participant receives in this situation is, to some degree, illusory. This same observation applies to other studies mentioned in the remainder of this article.",

He noted that any test triplet could either conform or not conform to the rule, as defined by the experimenter, and it could also either conform or not conform to the hypothesis being considered by the participant. Any given test case could relate to the rule and hypothesis in combination in any of four ways: conformconform, conform-not conform, not conformconform, and not conform-not conform. Wetherick argued that one could not determine whether an individual was intentionally attempting to eliminate a candidate hypothesis unless one could distinguish between test cases that were selected because they conformed to a hypothesis under consideration and those that were selected because they did not.",

A positive answer to the triplet 3-5-7 logically eliminates even numbers ascending and a number, twice the number, three times the number, among other possibilities, regardless of whether the participant thought of them. But of course, only if the triplet was selected with the intention of ruling out those options should its selection be taken as an instance of a falsification strategy. Wetherick's point was that without knowing what people have in mind in making the selections they do, one cannot tell whether they are attempting to eliminate candidates from further consideration or not. Wason (1962 Wason ( , 1968 Wason ( /1977) ) responded to this objection with further analyses of the data from the original experiment and data from additional experiments showing that although some participants gave evidence of understanding the concept of falsification, many did not. Wason summarized the findings from these experiments this way: \"there would appear to be compelling evidence to indicate that even intelligent individuals adhere to their own hypotheses with remarkable tenacity when they can produce confirming evidence for them\" (1968/1977, p. 313) .",

In a study representative of this body of work, participants would be asked to assess the personality of a person they are about to meet. Some would be given a sketch of an extrovert (sociable, talkative, outgoing) and asked to determine whether the person is that type. Others would be asked to determine whether the person is an introvert (shy, timid, quiet) . Participants tend to ask questions that, if given positive answers, would be seen as strongly confirmatory and that, if given negative answers, would be weakly disconfirmatory of the personality type for which they are primed to look (Snyder, 1981; Snyder & Swann, 1978a) . Some of the questions that people ask in these situations are likely to evoke similar answers from extroverts and introverts (Swann, Giuliano, & Wegner, 1982) -answers not very diagnostic with respect to personality type. When this is the case, askers find it easy to see the answers they get as supportive of the hypothesis with which they are working, independently of what that hypothesis is.",

For example, if the interrogator hypothesizes that the interviewee is an extrovert and asks questions that an extrovert would be expected to answer in the affirmative, the interviewee is more likely than not to answer in the affirmative independently of his or her personality type. Snyder, Tanke, and Berscheid (1977) have reported a related phenomenon. They found that male participants acted differently in a phone conversation toward female participants who had been described as attractive than toward those who had been described as unnattractive, and that their behavior evoked more desirable responses from the \"attractive\" than from the \"unattractive\" partners.",

And they can involve induced expectations regarding oneself as well as others (Mischel, Ebbensen, & Zeiss, 1973) . Pennebaker and Skelton (1978) have pointed out how a confirmation bias can reinforce the worst fears of a hypochondriac. The body more or less continuously provides one with an assortment of signals that, if attended to, could be interpreted as symptoms of illness of one sort or another. Normally people ignore these signals. However, if one suspects that one is ill, one is likely to begin to attend to these signals and to notice those that are consistent with the assumed illness. Ironically, the acquisition of factual knowledge about diseases and their symptoms may exacerbate the problem. Upon learning of a specific illness and the symptoms that signal its existence, one may look for those symptoms in one's own body, thereby increasing the chances of detecting them even if they are not out of the normal range (Woods, Matterson, & Silverman, 1966) .",

The belief that two variables are related appears to increase the chances that one will find evidence consistent with the relationship and decrease the chances of obtaining evidence that tends to disconfirm it. Judgments of covariation tend to be more accurate when people lack strong preconceptions of the relationship between the variables of interest or when the relationship is consistent with their preconceptions than when they have preconceptions that run counter to the relationship that exists.",

The term also has been applied when the variables in question are correlated but the correlation is perceived to be higher than it actually is Chapman and Chapman (1967a , 1967b , 1969 ; see also Chapman, 1967) did early work on the phenomenon. These investigators had participants view drawings of human figures, each of which occurred with two statements about the characteristics of the person who drew it. Statements were paired with drawings in such a way as to ensure no relationship between drawings and personality types, nevertheless participants saw the relationships they expected to see. Nisbett and Ross (1980) summarized the Chapmans' work on illusory correlation by saying that \"reported covariation was shown to reflect true covariation far less than it reflected theories or preconceptions of the nature of the associations that 'ought' to exist\" (p. 97). Goldberg (1968) said that this research \"illustrates the ease with which one can 'learn' relationships which do not exist\" (p. 493). For present purposes, it provides another illustration of how the confirmation bias can work: the presumption of a relationship predisposes one to find evidence of that relationship, even when there is none to be found or, if there is evidence to be found, to overweight it and arrive at a conclusion that goes beyond what the evidence justifies.",

An illusion of consistency, according to this view, leads people to misjudge the extent to which a friendly individual's behavior is consistently friendly or a hostile individual's behavior is consistently hostile (Jennings, Amabile, & Ross, 1982; Mischel, 1968; Mischel & Peake, 1982) . It is easy to see how a pervasive confirmation bias could be implicated in this illusion: once one has categorized an individual as friendly or hostile, one will be more attuned to evidence that supports that categorization than to evidence that undermines it.",

In a well-known version of this task, participants see an array of cards and are told that each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other. Each of the cards they see shows either a vowel, a consonant, an even number, or an odd number, and participants are asked to indicate which cards one would have to turn over in order to determine the truth or falsity of the following statement: If a card has a vowel on one side then it has an even number on the other side.",

In short, one can determine the claim to be false by finding either the card showing the A or the card showing the 7 to be inconsistent with it, or one can determine the claim to be true by finding both of these cards to be consistent with it. Wason found that people performing this task are most likely to select only the card showing a vowel or the card showing a vowel and the one showing an even number; people seldom select either the card showing a consonant or the one showing an odd number. Numerous investigators have obtained essentially the same result.

In the case of the above example, P is there is a vowel on one side, and Q is there is an even number on the other. Selecting the card showing the 7 is analogous to checking to see if the not-Q case is accompanied by not-P, as it must be if the conditional is true. The basic finding of experiments with the task lends support to the hypothesis-which is supported also by other research (Evans, Newstead, & Byrne, 1993; Hollis, 1970) -that people find the modus tollens argument (not-Q, therefore not-P) to be less natural than the modus ponens form (P, therefore Q). And it is consistent with the idea that, given the objective of assessing the credibility of a conditional assertion, people are more likely to look for the presence of the consequent given the presence of the antecedent than for the absence of the antecedent given the absence of the consequent.",

As applied to the selection task, confirmation bias has typically connoted a tendency to look for the joint occurrence of the items specified in the task description.

An idea common to several of these explanations is that people's performance of the task is indicative of behavior that has proved to be adaptively effective in analogous real-world situations. Cosmides (1989) , for example, has argued that the typical results are consistent with the idea that people are predisposed to look for cheating on a social contract and are particularly skilled at detecting it. Consequently, they do well on selection tasks in which checking the not-Q condition is analogous to looking for an instance of violating a tacit social agreement, like failing to meet an obligation. Gigerenzer and Hug (1992) have defended a similar point of view. Liberman and Klar (1996) proposed an alternative explanation of the results of research on cheating detection. They argued that a cheating-detection perspective is neither necessary nor sufficient to yield the P and not-Q selection; they contend that the logically correct choice will be likely if the conditional ifP then Q is understood to represent a deterministic (as opposed to a probabilistic) unidirectional relationship between P and Q, if what constitutes a violation of the rule is clear, and if it is understood that the task is to look for such a violation.",

Oaksford and Chater (1994) , for example, have proposed a model of the task according to which people should make selections so as to maximize their gain in information regarding the tenability of the hypothesis that the conditional ifP then Q is true relative to the tenability that it is false. I have done an analysis that leads to a similar conclusion, at least when the task is perceived as that of deciding whether the conditional is true in a general sense, as opposed to being true of four specific cards (Nickerson, 1996) .",

This is called the primacy effect. People often form an opinion early in the process and then evaluate subsequently acquired information in a way that is partial to that opinion (N. H. Anderson & Jacobson, 1965; Jones & Goethals, 1972; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Webster, 1964) . Francis Bacon (1620 Bacon ( /1939 ) observed this tendency centuries ago: \"the first conclusion colors and brings into conformity with itself all that come after\" (p. 36). Peterson and DuCharme (1967) had people sample a sequence of colored chips and estimate the probability that the sequence came from an urn with a specified distribution of colors rather than from a second urn with a different distribution. The sampling was arranged so that the first 30 trials favored one urn, the second 30 favored the other, and after 60 trials the evidence was equally strong for each possibility. Participants tended to favor the urn indicated by the first 30 draws, which is to say that the evidence in the first 30 draws was not countermanded by the evidence in the second 30 even though statistically it should have been. Bruner and Potter (1964) showed people the same picture on a series of slides. The first slide was defocused so the picture was not recognizable. On successive slides the focus was made increasingly clear. After each presentation the participant was asked to identify what was shown. A hypothesis formed on the basis of a defocused picture persisted even after the picture was in sufficiently good focus that participants who had not looked at the poorly focused picture were able to identify it correctly. Jones, Rock, Shaver, Goethals, and Ward (1968) had participants form opinions about people's problem-solving abilities by watching them in action. The problem solvers were judged to be more competent if they solved many problems early in a problem series and few late than if they did the reverse.",

Moreover it can bias the evaluation and interpretation of evidence that is subsequently acquired. People are more likely to question information that conflicts with preexisting beliefs than information that is consistent with them and are more likely to see ambiguous information to be confirming of preexisting beliefs than disconfirming of them (Ross & Anderson, 1982) .

As the participants made their choices, they were given feedback according to a predetermined schedule that was independent of the choices they made, but that insured that the feedback some participants received indicated that they performed far above average on the task while that which others received indicated that they performed far below average. Following completion of Ross et al.'s (1975) task, researchers informed participants of the arbitrary nature of the feedback and told them that their rate of \"success\" or \"failure\" was predetermined and independent of their choices. When the participants were later asked to rate their ability to make such judgments, those who had received much positive feedback on the experimental task rated themselves higher than did those who had received negative feedback, despite being told that they had been given arbitrary information. A follow-up experiment found similar perseverance for people who observed others performing this task (but did not perform it themselves) and also observed the debriefing session. Nisbett and Ross (1980) pointed out how a confirmation bias could contribute to the perseverance of unfounded beliefs of the kind involved in experiments like this. Receiving feedback that supports the assumption that one is particularly good or particularly poor at a task may prompt one to search for additional information to confirm that assumption. To the extent that such a search is successful, the belief that persists may rest not exclusively on the fraudulent feedback but also on other evidence that one has been able to find (selectively) in support of it.",

Thus researchers can determine for each confidence judgment the percentage of the correct items on the primary task to which that judgment was assigned. Plots of actual percent correct against percent correct \"predicted\" by the confidence judgments are often referred to as calibration curves; perfect calibration is represented by the unit line, which indicates that for a given confidence level, X, the proportion of all the judgments with that level that were correct was X.",

Juslin (1993) has argued that certain strategies commonly used to select items in experiments more or less ensure that valid knowledge from the participants' natural environment will be less valid in the experimental situation. More specifically, the argument is that such selection strategies typically result in sets of items for which cues leading to wrong answers are overrepresented relative to their commonness in the natural environment. Experiments showing good calibration for items selected at random from a set assumed to be representative of the natural environment (Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Kleinbolting, 1991; Juslin, 1993 Juslin, , 1994 ) support this explanation. I believe this argument to be a forceful one. The evidence is fairly strong that some of the overconfidence reported, especially in experiments that require people to answer generalknowledge questions in a forced-choice format, is an artifact of item-selection procedures that do not ensure that cues have the same validity in experimental situations that they have in typical real-life situations. Not all studies of confidence or calibration have used general-knowledge questions and the forced-choice format for answers, however, and overconfidence has also been observed in other contexts. Researchers have shown that assessments of peoples' ability to recognize faces, for example, correlate poorly with performance on a face-recognition task (Baddeley & Woodhead, 1983 ) and observed that retrospective judgments of comprehension of expository texts are higher than justified (Glenberg, Wilkinson, & Epstein, 1982) .",

On the other hand, despite the fact that clinical diagnoses based on case statistics tend to be more accurate than those based on clinical judgments, clinicians typically have greater confidence in their own judgments than in those derived statistically from incidence data (Arkes, Dawes, & Christensen, 1986; Goldberg, 1968; Meehl, 1954 Meehl, , 1960;; Sawyer, 1966) . In contrast, professional weather forecasters tend to be relatively well calibrated, at least with respect to their weather predictions (Murphy & Winkler, 1974 , 1977; Winkler & Murphy, 1968) ; this has been attributed to the fact that they receive constant and immediate feedback regarding the accuracy of their predictions, which is the kind of information that makes learning feasible. Griffin and Tversky (1992) have made a distinction between strength (extremeness) of evidence and weight (predictive validity) of evidence. They hypothesized that people tend to focus primarily on strength and make some (typically insufficient) adjustments in response to weight. This hypothesis leads to the expectation that overconfidence will be the rule especially when strength is high and weight low, whereas underconfidence becomes more likely when the opposite is the case. This account is consistent with the finding that overconfidence is the general rule because of the assumed greater importance attached to evidentiary strength. The account is even more predictive of general overconfidence if one assumes that strong evidence is more common than weighty evidence, as Griffin and Tversky use these terms.",

Much of this fascination is due to certain mathematical relationships discussed first by John Taylor (1859) and shortly later by Charles Smyth (1864/1890). Taylor noted, among other facts, that the ratio of twice the pyramid's base to its height was roughly the same as the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference, which is to say, IT. Smyth was inspired by Taylor's observations and set himself the task of discovering other mathematical relationships of interest that the monument might hide.",

By comparing pyramid length measurements in various ways, he was able to find numbers that correspond to many quantitative properties of the world that were presumably unknown when the pyramid was built. These include the earth's mean density, the period of precession of the earth's axis, and the mean temperature of the earth's surface. Von Daniken (1969) used the existence of such relationships as the basis for arguing that the earth had been visited by intelligent extraterrestrials in the past. Gardner (1957) referred to Smyth's book as a classic of its kind illustrating beautifully \"the ease with which an intelligent man, passionately convinced of a theory, can manipulate his subject matter in such a way as to make it conform to precisely held opinions\" (p. 176). He pointed out that a complicated structure like the pyramid provides one with a great assortment of possible length measurements, and that anyone with the patience to juggle them is quite sure to find a variety of numbers that will coincide with some dates or figures that are of interest for historical or scientific reasons. One simply makes an enormous number of observations, tries every manipulation on measurements and measurement relationships that one can imagine, and then selects from the results those few that coincide with numbers of interest in other contexts. He wrote, \"Since you are bound by no rules, it would be odd indeed if this search for Pyramid 'Truths' failed to meet with considerable success\" (p. 177). The search for pyramid truths is a striking illustration of how a bias to confirm is expressed by selectivity in the search for and interpretation of information.",

On the other hand, it is perhaps too easy to assume that nothing like the witchcraft mania could occur in our enlightened age. A moment's reflection on the instances of genocide or attempted genocide that have occurred in recent times should make people wary of any such assumption. These too can be seen as instances of what can happen when special rules of evidence are used to protect and support beliefs that individuals, groups or nations want, for whatever reasons, very much to hold.

Bleeding, purging, cupping, the administration of infusions of every known plant, solutions of every known metal, every conceivable diet including total fasting, most of these based on the weirdest imaginings about the cause of disease, concocted out of nothing but thin air-this was the heritage of medicine up until a little over a century ago. It is astounding that the profession survived so long, and got away with so much with so little outcry. Almost everyone seems to have been taken in. (p. 159) How is it that ineffective measures could be continued for decades or centuries without their ineffectiveness being discovered? Sometimes people got better when they were treated; sometimes they did not. And sometimes they got better when they were not treated at all. It appears that people's beliefs about the efficacy of specific treatments were influenced more strongly by those instances in which treatment was followed by recovery than in either those in which it was not or those in which it occurred spontaneously. A prevailing tendency to focus exclusively or primarily on positive casescases in which treatment was followed by recovery-would go a long way toward accounting for the fact that the discoveries that certain diseases have a natural history and people often recover from them with or without treatment was not made until the 19th century.",

During the jury-deliberation phase, the jury's task is to review and consider, collectively, the evidence that has been presented and to arrive, through discussion and debate, at a consensus on the verdict.

Whether jurors are able to follow this admonition and to delay forming an opinion as to the truth or falsity of the allegations against the accused until the jury-deliberation phase is a matter of some doubt. It is at least a plausible possibility that individual jurors (and judges) develop their personal mental models of \"what really happened\" as a case develops and continuously refine and elaborate those models as evidence continues to be presented (Holstein, 1985) . To the extent that this is the way jurors actually think, a model, as it exists at any point in time, may strongly influence how new information is interpreted. If one has come to believe that a defendant is guilty (or innocent), further evidence that is open to various interpretations may be seen as supportive of that belief. Opinions formed about a defendant on the basis of superficial cues (such as demeanor while giving testimony) can bias the interpretation of inherently ambiguous evidence (Hendry & Shaffer, 1989) .",

If observations could not be made to fit, they might be allowed to stand along the cultural sidelines as curiosities, exceptions, freaks of nature.

The belief that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter ones, for example, prevailed from the time of Aristotle until that of Galileo. The experiments that Galileo performed to demonstrate that this belief was false could have been done at any time during that 2000-year period. This is a particularly interesting example of a persisting false belief because it might have been questioned strictly on the basis of reasoning, apart from any observations. Galileo posed a question that could have been asked by Aristotle or by anybody who believed that heavier bodies fall faster than lighter ones: If a 10 pound weight falls faster than a 1 pound weight, what will happen when the two are tied together? Will the 11 pound combination fall faster than the 10 pound weight, or will it fall more slowly because the 1 pound weight will hold back the 10 pound one? Hawking (1988) argued that the fact that the universe is expanding could have been predicted from Newton's theory of gravity at any time after the late 17th century, and noted that Newton himself realized that the idea of universal gravity begged an explanation as to why the stars did not draw together. The assumption that the universe was static was a strong and persistent one, however. Newton dealt with the problem by assuming the universe was infinite and consequently had no center onto which it could collapse. Others introduced a notion that at very great distances gravity became repulsive instead of attractive. Einstein, in order to make his general theory of relativity compatible with the idea of a static universe, incorporated a \"cosmological constant\" in the theory which, in effect, nullified the otherwise expected contraction. Einstein later was embarrassed by this invention and saw it as his greatest mistake.",

If that proves to be too difficult, one may decide simply to live with the anomaly, at least for a while.

The correlation could reflect a relationship between truth and desirability in the real world, whereby what is likely to be true is likely also to be desirable, and the same is conversely true. On the other hand, the evidence is strong that the correlation is the result, at least to some degree, of beliefs being influenced by preferences.

Suppose that one must attempt to decide which of two diseases, A or B, a patient with Symptoms X and Y has. One is informed of the relative frequency of Symptom X among people who have Disease A and is then given the choice of obtaining either of the following items of information: the relative frequency of people with A who have Symptom Y or the relative frequency of people with B who have symptom X. Most people who have been given choices of this sort opt for the first; they continue to focus on the hypothesis that the patient has A, even though learning the relative frequency of Y given A does not inform the diagnosis, whereas learning the relative frequency of X given B does.",

The idea that people tend to expose themselves more to information sources that share their beliefs than to those that do not has had considerable credibility among social psychologists (Festinger, 1957; Klapper, 1960) . Sears and Freedman (1967) have challenged the conclusiveness of much of the evidence that has been evoked in support of this idea. They noted that, when given a choice of information that is supportive of a view one holds and information that is supportive of an opposing view, people sometimes select the former and sometimes the latter, and sometimes they show no preference. Behavior in these situations seems to depend on a number of factors in addition to the polarity of the information with respect to one's existing views, such as people's level of education or social status and the perceived usefulness of the information that is offered. Sears and Freedman (1967) stopped short, however, of concluding that people are totally unbiased in this respect. They noted the possibility that \"dramatic selectivity in preferences may not appear at any given moment in time, but, over a long period, people may organize their surroundings in a way that ensures de facto selectivity\" (p. 213). People tend to associate, on a long-term basis, with people who think more or less as they do on matters important to them; they read authors with whom they tend to agree, listen to news commentators who interpret current events in a way that they like, and so on. The extent to which people choose their associates because of their beliefs versus forming their beliefs because of their associates is an open question. But it seems safe to assume that it goes a bit in both directions. Finding lots of support for one's beliefs and opinions would be a natural consequence of principally associating with people with whom one has much in common. Gilovich (1991) made the important point that for many beliefs or expectations confirmatory events are likely to be more salient than nonconfirmatory ones. If a fortune teller predicts several events in one's life sometime during the indefinite future, for example, the occurrence of any predicted event is more likely to remind one of the original prediction of that event than is its nonoccurrence. Events predicted by a fortune teller illustrate one-sided events. Unlike twosided events, which have the characteristic that their nonoccurrence is as noticeable as their occurrence, one-sided events are likely to be noticed while their nonoccurrence is not. (An example of a two-sided event would be the toss of a coin following the prediction of a head. In this case the nonoccurrence of the predicted outcome would be as noticeable as its occurrence.)",

One could argue that this preclusion may be justified if the hypothesis is correct, or nearly so, and if the negative consequences of one type of error (admitting many students who will fail) are much greater than those of the other type (failing to admit a few students who would succeed).

Application of this strategy involves testing a hypothesis either by considering conditions under which the hypothesized event is expected to occur (to see if it does occur) or by examining known instances of its occurrence (to see if the hypothesized conditions prevailed). The phenomenon bears some resemblance to the finding that, in the absence of compelling evidence one way or the other, people are more inclined to assume that a statement is true than to assume that it is false (Clark & Chase, 1972; Gilbert, 1991; Trabasso, Rollins, & Shaughnessy, 1971; Wallsten & Gonzalez-Vallejo, 1994) . Baron, Beattie, and Hershey (1988) , who referred to the positive-test strategy as the congruence heuristic, have shown that the tendency to use it can be reduced if people are asked to consider alternatives, but that they tend not to consider them spontaneously. The fact that people show a preference for questions that would yield a positive answer if the hypothesis is correct over questions that would yield a negative answer if the hypothesis is correct demonstrates that the positive-test strategy is not a simple consequence of the confirmation bias (Baron et al., 1988; Devine, Hirt, & Gehrke, 1990; Skov & Sherman, 1986) .",

In both of the examples considered, the strategy is to select instances for testing that satisfy the hypothesized rule; it is effective in revealing the rule to be wrong in the second case, not because the tester intentionally selects instances that will show the rule to be wrong if it is wrong, but because the relationship between hypothesized and correct rules is such that the tester is likely to discover the hypothesized rule to be wrong by selecting test cases intended to show that it is right.

One might select, say, 6-7-8 for either of the following reasons, among others: (a) because one believes the rule to be increasing numbers and wants a triplet that fits the rule, or (b) because one believes the rule to be successive even numbers and wants to increase one's confidence in this belief by selecting a triplet that fails to satisfy the rule. The chooser expects the experimenter's response to the selected triplet to be positive in the first case and negative in the second. In either case, the experimenter's response could be opposite from what the chooser expects and show the hypothesized rule to be wrong; the response is adventitious because the test yielded information that the chooser was not seeking and did not expect to obtain.",

People appear to be much less likely to attempt to get evidence for a hypothesized rule by choosing a case that they believe does not fit it (and expecting an informative-negative response) or to select cases with the intended purpose of ruling out one or more currently plausible hypotheses from further consideration. When a test that was expected to yield an outcome that is positive with respect to a hypothesized rule does not do so, it seems appropriate to say that the positive-test strategy has proved to be adventitiously informative. Clearly, it is possible to select an item that is consistent with a hypothesized rule for the purpose of revealing an alternative rule to be wrong, but there is little evidence that this is often done. It seems that people generally select test items that are consistent with the rule they believe to be correct and seldom select items with falsification in mind. Klayman and Ha (1987) argued that the positive-test strategy is sometimes appropriate and sometimes not, depending on situational variables such as the base rates of the phenomena of interest, and that it is effective under commonly occurring conditions. They argued too, however, that people tend to rely on it overly much, treating it as a default strategy to be used when testing must be done under less-than-ideal conditions, and that it accounts for many of the phenomena that are generally interpreted as evidence of a pervasive confirmation bias. Evans (1989) has proposed an explanation of the confirmation bias that is similar in some respects to Klayman and Ha's (1987) account and also discounts the possibility that people intentionally seek to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses. Cognitive failure, and not motivation, he argued, is the basis of the phenomenon: Subjects confirm, not because they want to, but because they cannot think of the way to falsify. The cognitive failure is caused by a form of selective processing which is very fundamental indeed in cognition-a bias to think about positive rather than negative information, (p. 42) With respect to Wason's (1960) results with the number-triplet task, Evans suggested that rather than attempting to confirm the hypotheses they were entertaining, participants may simply have been unable to think of testing them in a This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.",

Participants select named items in this task, according to this view, because these are the only ones that come to mind when they are thinking about what to do. The bias that is operating is not that of wanting to confirm a tentative hypothesis but that of being strongly inclined to think only of information that is explicitly provided in the problem statement. In short, Evans (1989) distinguished between confirmatory behavior, which he acknowledges, and confirmatory intentions, which he denies. The \"demonstrable deficiencies in the way in which people go about testing and eliminating hypotheses,\" he contended, \"are a function of selective processing induced by a widespread cognitive difficulty in thinking about any information which is essentially negative in its conception\" (p. 63). The tendency to focus on positive information and fail to consider negative information is regarded not as a conscious cognitive strategy but as the result of preattentive processes. Positive is not synonymous with confirmatory, but as most studies have been designed, looking for positive cases is tantamount to looking for confirmation.",

Evans's (1989) argument that such a bias can account, at least in part, for some of the phenomena that are attributed to a confirmation bias is an intuitively plausible one. A study in which Perkins et al., (1983) classified errors of reasoning made in informal arguments constructed by over 300 people of varying age and educational level supports the argument.

In some cases, people who were asked to explain why a particular event had occurred and then were informed that the event did not occur after they did so, still considered the event more \"likely\" than did others who were not asked to explain why it might occur (Ross et al., 1977) . Koehler (1991) , who has reviewed much of the work on how explanations influence beliefs, has suggested that producing an explanation is not the critical factor and that simply coming up with a focal hypothesis is enough to increase one's confidence in it. Anything, he suggested, that induces one to accept the truth of a hypothesis temporarily will increase one's confidence that it is, in fact, true. Calling attention to a specified hypothesis results in the establishment of a focal hypothesis, and this in turn induces the adoption of a conditional reference frame, in which the focal hypothesis is assumed to be true.",

According to this author, Once a conditional reference frame has been induced by an explanation task, a certain inertia sets in, which makes it more difficult to consider alternative hypotheses impartially. In other words, the initial impression seems to persist despite the person's efforts to ignore it while trying to give fair consideration to an alternative view. (p. 503) Hoch's (1984) findings regarding people who were asked to generate reasons for expecting a specified event and reasons against expecting it support Koehler's conclusion: in Hoch's study those who generated the pro reasons first and the con reasons later considered the event more probable than did those who generated the pro and con reasons in the opposite order. Koehler related the phenomenon to that of mental set or fixedness that is sometimes described in discussions of problem solving. He argued that adopting a conditional reference frame to determine confidence in a hypothesis is probably a good general method but that, like other heuristic methods, it also can yield overconfidence in some instances.",

When, for example, the undesirable consequences of judging a true hypothesis to be false are greater than those of judging a false hypothesis to be true, a bias toward confirmation is dictated by some normative models of reasoning and by common sense. Friedrich (1993) argued that \"our inference processes are first and foremost pragmatic, survival mechanisms and only secondarily truth detection strategies\" (p. 298). In this view, peoples' inferential strategies are well suited to the identification of potential rewards and the avoidance of costly errors, but not to the objective of hypothesis testing in accordance with the logic of science. Inference strategies that are often considered to be seriously flawed not only may have desired effects in real-world contexts, but may also be seen as correct when judged in terms of an appropriate standard.",

                "text": "To illustrate the point, Friedrich (1993) used the example of an employer who wants to test the hunch that extroverts make the best salespeople. If the employer checked the sales performance only of extroverts, found it to be very good and, on this basis, decided to hire only extroverts for sales positions, one would say that she had not made an adequate test of her hunch because she did not rule out the possibility that introverts might do well at sales also. But if her main objective was to avoid hiring people who will turn out to be poor at sales, satisfying herself that extroverts make good sales people suffices; the fact that she has not discovered that introverts can be good at sales too could mean that she will miss some opportunities by not hiring them, but it does not invalidate the decision to hire extroverts if the objective is to ensure that poor performers do not get hired. Schwartz (1982) also argued that when responses have consequences that really matter, people are more likely to be concerned about producing desirable outcomes than about determining the truth or falsity of hypotheses. Contingent reinforcement may create functional behavioral units that people tend to repeat because the behaviors have worked in the past, and a bias toward confirmation is one of the stereotyped forms of behavior in which the operation of these units manifests itself. In performing a rule-discovery task, one may be attempting to maximize the probability of getting a positive response, which is tantamount to seeking a rule that is sufficient but not necessary to do so. Given that one has identified a condition that is sufficient for producing desired outcomes, there may be no compelling reason to attempt to determine whether that condition is also necessary. Schwartz pointed out too that, especially in social situations such as some of those studied by Snyder and colleagues attempting to evaluate hypotheses by falsification would require manipulating people and could involve considerable social cost. Baron (1994) noted that truth seeking or hypothesis testing often may be combined with one or more other goals, and that one's behavior then also must be interpreted in the light of the other goal(s). If, for example, one is curious as to why a cake turned out well despite the fact that certain ingredients were substituted for those called for by the recipe, one may be motivated to explore the effects of the substitutions in such a way that the next experimental cake is likely to turn out well too.",

If one is constantly urged to present reasons for opinions that one holds and is not encouraged also to articulate reasons that could be given against them, one is being trained to exercise a confirmation bias. Narveson (1980) noted that when students write compositions, they typically evaluate their claims by considering supporting evidence only. He argued that standard methods for teaching composition foster this. The extent to which the educational process makes explicit the distinction between case-building and evidenceweighing deserves more attention. If the distinction is not made and what is actually casebuilding passes for the impartial use of evidence, this could go some way toward accounting for the pervasiveness and strength of the confirmation bias among educated adults.",

This is to say there must be a way to show the explanation to be false if in fact it is false. Popper focused on falsifiability as the distinguishing characteristic of the scientific method because of a conviction that certain theories of the day (in particular, Marx's theory of history, Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, and Adler's individual psychology) \"appeared to be able to explain practically everything that happened within the fields to which they referred\" (Popper, 1962 (Popper, /1981, p. 94), p. 94) . Thus subscribers to any one of these theories were likely to see confirming evidence anywhere they looked. According to Popper (1959) , the most characteristic element in this situation seemed to be the incessant stream of confirmations, of observations which 'verified' the theories in question; and this point was constantly emphasized by their adherents\" (p. 94). There was, in Popper's view, no conceivable evidence that could be brought to bear on any of these theories that would be viewed by an adherent as grounds for judging it to be false. Einstein's theory of relativity impressed Popper as being qualitatively different in the important respect that it made risky predictions, which is to say predictions that were incompatible with specific possible results of observation. This theory was, in principle, refutable by empirical means and therefore qualified as scientific according to Popper's criterion.",

It is foreshadowed, for example, in the Socratic method of refutation (elenchos), according to which what is to be taken as truth is whatever survives relentless efforts at refutation (Maclntyre, 1988) . Lakatos (1976 Lakatos ( , 1978) ) and Polya (1954a Polya ( , 1954b) ) have discussed the importance of this attitude in reasoning in mathematics-especially in proofmaking-at length. The principle of falsifiability was also anticipated by T. H. Huxley (1894 Huxley ( /1908)) , who spoke of \"a beautiful hypoth-esis killed by an ugly fact,\" and by David Hartley (1748 Hartley ( /1981)) , who proposed a rule of false. According to this rule, the acceptability of any supposition or hypothesis should be its ability to provide the basis for the deduction of observable phenomena: \"He that forms hypotheses from the first, and tries them by the facts, soon rejects the most unlikely ones; and being freed from these, is better qualified for the examination of those that are probable\" (p. 90).",

Typically an established theory has been discarded only after a better theory has been offered to replace it. Perhaps this should not be surprising. What astronomer, Waismann (1952) asked, would abandon Kepler's laws on the strength of a single observation? Scientists have not discarded the idea that light travels at a constant speed of about 300,000 kilometers per second and that nothing can travel faster simply because of the discovery of radio sources that seem to be emanating from a single quasar and moving away from each other at more than nine times that speed (Gardner, 1976 ).

Should we view such a bias as beneficial overall or detrimental to the enterprise? An extensive discussion of this question is beyond the scope of this article. However, it can be argued that a degree of conservativism plays a stabilizing role in science and guards the field against uncritical acceptance of so-called discoveries that fail to stand the test of time. Price (1963) referred to conservatism in the body of science as \"a natural counterpart to the open-minded creativity that floods it with too many new ideas\" (p. 64). Justification for a certain degree of conservatism is found in the embarrassment that the scientific community has occasionally experienced as a consequence of not being sufficiently sceptical of new discoveries. The discovery of magnetic monopoles, which was widely publicized before a close examination of the evidence forced more guarded interpretations, and that of polywater, which motivated hundreds of research projects over decade following its discovery in the 1960s, are examples.",

The idea of continental drift was not entirely new with Wegener, for example, although Wegener was the first to propose a well-developed theory. A serious limitation of the theory was its failure to identify a force of sufficient magnitude to account for the hypothesized movement of continents. (The notion of plate tectonics and evidence regarding sea-floor spreading came much later; LeGrand, 1988.) Solomon (1992) argued that it was, in part, because Wegener was not trained as a geologist and therefore not steeped in the \"stabilist\" theories of the time, that his thinking, relatively unconstrained by prior beliefs about the stability of continents, could easily embrace a possibility that was so contrary to the prevailing view. She pointed out too that when geologists began to accept the notion of drift, as evidence favoring it accumulated, it was those with low publication rates who were the most likely to do so: \"their beliefs were less entrenched (cognitively speaking) than those who had reasoned more and produced more, so belief perseverance was less of an impediment to acceptance of drift\" (p. 449).",

They noted that a reluctance by scientists to relinquish pet beliefs is only one interpretation that could be put on the finding. Another possibility is that what appears to be biased behavior reflects \"a belief that investigators who report disconfirming results tend to use inferior research methods (e.g., small samples leading to more spurious results), to commit common mistakes in experimental design, or, simply, to be charlatans\" (Fischoff and Beyth-Marom, 1983, p. 251) . To the extent that such a belief is accurate, a bias against the ready acceptance of results that are disconfirming of prevailing hypotheses can be seen as a safeguard against precipitous changes of view that may prove to be unjustified.

That is not to say that dogmatic confidence in one's own beliefs and intolerance of opposing views can never work to one's advantage. Boorstin (1958) argued, for example, that it was precisely these qualities that permitted the 17th-century New England Puritans to establish a society with the ingredients necessary for survival and prosperity. He wrote, Had they spent as much of their energy in debating with each other as did their English contemporaries, they might have lacked the single-mindedness needed to overcome the dark, unpredictable perils of a wilderness. They might have merited praise as precursors of modern liberalism, but they might never have helped found a nation, (p. 9) Contrary to the popular stereotype of the Puritans, they were not preoccupied with religious dogma but rather with more practical matters because, as Boorstin noted, they had no doubts and allowed no dissent. They worried about such problems as how to select leaders and representatives, the way to establish the proper limits of political power, and how to construct a feasible federal organization.",

Some beliefs are shaped over many years, and the fact that one cannot articulate every reason one has or has ever had for a particular one of them does not mean that it is unfounded. Also, as Nisbett and Ross (1980) pointed out, there are practical time constraints that often limit the amount of processing of new information one can do. In view of these limitations, the tendency to persevere may be a stabilizing hedge against overly frequent changes of view that would result if one were obliged to hold only beliefs that one could justify explicitly at a moment's notice. This argument is not unlike the one advanced by Blackstone (1769 Blackstone ( /1962) ) in defense of not lightly scuttling legal traditions.",

We may look for evidence that is embarrassing to hypotheses we disbelieve or especially dislike, but this can be seen as looking for evidence that is supportive of the complementary hypotheses. The point is that we seldom seem to seek evidence naturally that would show a hypothesis to be wrong and to do so because we understand this to be an effective way to show it to be right if it really is right.",
