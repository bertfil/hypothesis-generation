    "abstract": "How do politicians cope with questions and interruptions? How do they invite applause and audience appreciation? How often do they avoid replying to questions, how and why do they do this and what are the consequences of their evasions? Such questions are posed and answered by this series of original studies of political speeches and televised political interviews conducted by the author and his colleagues. They were based on the Annual Party Political Conferences (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) and the last five General Elections (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001) in the UK. Both verbal and non-verbal features of communication are examined, including hand gestures, applause, interruptions, questions, replies and non-replies to questions.\nAs a result of applying the techniques of microanalysis, we have a greater awareness of how applause can occur both invited and uninvited in political speeches. We can evaluate more effectively the interview skills of both politicians and political interviewers. We have a better understanding of how and why politicians equivocate, handle interruptions and seek to present themselves in the best possible light. It is often the case that political speeches are dismissed as mere 'claptrap', while politicians are castigated for their evasiveness in interviews. But the detailed microanalytic research presented here brings fresh insights into the role played by this apparent 'claptrap and ambiguity' in the underlying political process.\nThis unique and highly contemporary study provides a rare interdisciplinary view of politics, communication and microanalysis. It will be valuable reading for advanced students and academics within the fields of social psychology, linguistics, political science, communication studies and sociology.",

Undoubtedly, the analysis of film, audiotape and videotape recordings has facilitated discoveries which otherwise simply would not be possible. Indeed, the effect of the videotape recorder has been likened to that of the microscope in the biological sciences. Without recorded data which can repeatedly be examined, it is simply not possible to perform highly detailed analyses of both speech and nonverbal communication. But microanalysis did not develop simply as a consequence of innovations in technology. Film technology had been available since the beginning of the twentieth century; two of the earliest pioneers of cinematography, Muybridge and Marey, had a particular interest in analysing and recording movement patterns in animals and humans (Muybridge, 1899 (Muybridge, , 1901;; Marey, 1895) . The extensive use of this technology in the study of human social interaction has only really developed in the past few decades; its use reflects fundamental changes in the way in which we think about human communication (Kendon, 1982) .",

Their collaboration was based on a number of shared assumptions, which made their approach highly distinctive. Thus, Birdwhistell and Scheflen regarded communication as a tightly organised and self-contained social system like language, which operates according to a definite set of rules. They saw the task of the investigator as to identify and articulate those rules. As such, their research has been referred to as the 'structural approach' (Duncan, 1969) .",

The method he recommended was a natural history one: through repeated viewing of videotape, the researcher can identify which of the nonverbal cues are ordered in sequential arrangements (Scheflen, 1966) . One of his most important insights concerned the significance of what was termed 'postural congruence' -the way in which people imitate each other's postures. He observed that when people share similar views or social roles in a group, they often tend to express this by adopting similar postures (Scheflen, 1964) . Conversely, dissimilar postures can indicate a marked divergence in attitude or status. Posture mirroring may also be used as a means of establishing rapport; a person may imitate another's postures to indicate friendliness and togetherness. Thus, posture mirroring may be indicative of the relationship between people.",

He coined the term 'kinesics' to refer to the study of body movement, arguing that it could be analysed in a way that paralleled structural linguistics. In particular, he proposed that body motion is a learned form of communication, that it is patterned within a culture, and that it is structured according to rules comparable to those of spoken language. Those elements of body movement which are significant in communication he termed 'kinemes'. Of course, kinemes do not occur in isolation, they occur in patterns or combinations, referred to as 'kinemorphs' (by analogy with the linguistic term 'morpheme'). By the same token, kinemorphs can be organised into more complex patterns, referred to as 'kinemorphic constructions'.",

This referred to an alternative strategy of attempting to relate communication to features external to the social context. Thus, a researcher might seek to investigate whether particular nonverbal behaviours are associated with particular personality traits: for example, by correlating scores on a questionnaire measure of extraversion with duration or frequency of gaze. This approach at one time typified much psychological research on communication, and was rightly criticised for its failure to take account of the structural organisation of social interaction (Duncan, 1969) .

One important innovation was that he regarded everyday social interaction as something worthy of study in its own right, rather as a means of studying more traditional sociological concerns, such as a primitive or sophisticated mentality, or the structure of kinship or power relationships (Burns, 1992) . Another was his ability to take what might be regarded as commonplace observations, and to recast them in terms of a novel conceptual framework. Although he has had a profound influence, in no sense was his work based on the detailed analysis of either video or audio recordings. Rather, he worked from his own participant observations of social interaction, and from material such as etiquette books and advertisements. His significance was much more as a theorist, as someone who put forward a conceptual framework within which social interaction could be studied.",

A particularly good example of Goffman's influence can be seen in the impact of his first published article, 'On face-work: an analysis of ritual elements in social interaction ' (1955) . In this paper, he formulated a number of ideas concerning the importance of what he called 'face-work': strategies both for avoiding threats to face and repairing damage to face when it has occurred. Goffman's ideas have proved remarkably enduring. According to one review, the intellectual roots of virtually all contemporary research on face can be traced to this 'seminal' essay (Tracy, 1990) .",

Positive face concerns the desire to be appreciated by others, negative face the desire for freedom of action.

This concept of face has had an important influence on the studies of political interviews reported in this book (see especially Chapters 8-10).",

For example, 'back in a minute' becomes 'back inna minnit', while 'lighting a fire in Perry's cellar' becomes 'lightin' a fiyuh in Perry's celluh'. A number of conventions were also devised to indicate the sequential structure of utterances in conversation. A double oblique sign (//) indicates the point at which a current speaker's talk is overlapped by the talk of another, while an equals sign (\u03ed) refers to what was called 'latching', where there is no interval between the end of one person's utterance and the start of another. Subsequently, one researcher has even been concerned to devise highly detailed ways of representing different kinds of laughter (Jefferson, 1984) . In one excerpt, a laugh is transcribed as 'ihh hh heh heh huh', while in another a different form of laughter is transcribed as 'hhhh HA HA HA HA'. Thus, in conversation analysis, the transcription becomes an important part of the research. Through such faithful attention to detail, it was claimed that other analysts are given the opportunity to identify systematic regularities which might have eluded the initial investigators.",

His contribution was to supply the theoretical scaffolding; the nitty gritty of detailed microanalysis he left to others. With Sacks, it is entirely the reverse. Sacks et al. (1974) wrote that the aim of a conversation analysis transcript was 'to get as much of the actual sound as possible into our transcripts, while still making them accessible to linguistically unsophisticated readers'. The success of this procedure is seriously open to question. There are plenty of features of speech which such transcriptions omit, for example, tempo, pitch, loudness, vowel quality and voice quality. At the same time, there is also a problem that the attempt to reproduce the sound of speech can make the text quite impenetrable. So, for example, one of Sacks et al.'s (1974) extracts reads, 'I'd a' cracked up 'f duh friggin (gla-i(h)f y'kno(h)w it) sm(h)a(h) heh heh.'

The best technique is to view or listen to the tape in conjunction with a transcript, ideally in the form of a videorecording, so that researchers can not only hear what is said and how it is said, but can also see any associated nonverbal behaviour for themselves.

Initially, these ideas were elaborated by John Austin in 1955 in the William James lectures at Harvard University, subsequently to be published posthumously in 1962 under the title, How to do Things with Words. In order to acquire a fuller understanding of Austin's ideas, they need to be set in the context of academic philosophy at that time (Potter and Wetherell, 1987) . In particular, Austin was attacking the view of logical positivism, that if a sentence cannot be verified as either true or false, it should simply be regarded as meaningless. More broadly, Austin was attacking a whole spectrum of views which regarded the central function of language as describing a state of affairs, or stating some facts. In contrast, the main proposition of Speech Act Theory was that language can be regarded as a form of action.",

In contrast, Speech Act Theory focussed on language as a tool, as a means of doing things. In spite of this, Speech Act Theory is still essentially a branch of philosophy. It was developed primarily in the context of debates within philosophy, and little consideration was paid to the practical problems of applying the theory to everyday talk occurring in natural situations. Its enduring influence has come from other intellectual traditions such as conversation analysis and discourse analysis, which have sought to investigate empirically how social actions (such as ordering and requesting, persuading and accusing) are accomplished in language.",

                "text": "At least three main approaches can be distinguished (van Dijk, 1997). There are those that focus on discourse 'itself'; that is, on structures of text or talk. Such analyses are concerned with abstract properties such as the narrative structure of a story, the use of rhetorical devices in speeches, or the placing of headlines in news reports. Second, discourse may be analysed in terms of the social actions accomplished by language users. One of the themes strongly stressed in both Speech Act Theory and conversation analysis is that people use language to do things. This focus on language function or action is a major component of discourse analysis. Finally, analyses of discourse presuppose that language users have knowledge. To understand a sentence or to interpret the topic of a text presupposes that language users share a vast repertoire of sociocultural beliefs on which their interpretations are based. Hence, the analysis of cognition has been a third substantive area of research. One well-known example of discourse analysis is the work of Jonathan Potter, Margaret Wetherell and Derek Edwards. Their principal concern has been with language as a form of action, a means of accomplishing a variety of social functions. According to Potter and Wetherell (1987) , a person's use of language will vary according to its function; that is to say, it will vary according to the purpose of the talk. For example, in describing a person to a close friend on one occasion and to a parent on another, a narrator may emphasise very different personal characteristics. Neither of these accounts is seen as the 'true' or 'correct' one, they simply serve different functions.",

The proposal is not that some forms of talk are merely descriptive, while others are deliberately constructed: all language, even language which passes as simple description, is regarded as constructive. However, the term 'construction' is not meant to imply that the process is necessarily deliberate or intentional. The person who produces the account does not necessarily do this in a calculating or conscious way. Nevertheless, a version emerges as people try to make sense of something that has happened to them, or engage in such activities as justifying their own actions or blaming others.",

Thus, speakers endeavour to construct their account in such a way that it will be understood as factual, and not dismissed as partisan or simply biased.

In reporting events, speakers routinely deal with the accountability of the people they are describing for their actions. At the same time, speakers are also accountable for their own actions, including the accuracy and interactional consequences of the narratives which they produce. Thus, speakers may seek either to claim credit or to distance themselves from the events which they report, depending upon the function of the talk. The ways in which both these aspects of accountability are constructed in narratives is the focus of an approach from the perspective of discursive psychology.",

Conversely, discursive psychology is presented as a radical alternative to cognitive social psychology, a means whereby cognitive concepts such as memory, attitudes and attributions can be re-conceptualised in terms of discursive actions (Edwards and Potter, 1992) .

But if this is the case, it would appear as if all accounts are as good as one another, and there would appear to be no way to choose between them. Again, if neither thoughts, nor ideas nor attitudes can be inferred from discourse, then it might appear that there is nothing beyond discourse, and discourse analysis can only be used to make inferences about discourse. Taken to this extreme, discursive psychology seems to lead to a dead-end. However, relativism is not intrinsic to all discourse analysis; indeed, discursive psychology has been criticised by other discourse analysts precisely because of its relativist stance (e.g. Parker, 1992) .",

This is also true of another approach which stems from an entirely different intellectual tradition. Ethology developed initially as a branch of zoology, concerned with the study of animal behaviour in its natural habitat, but its techniques have subsequently been extended to the analysis of human behaviour. In ethology, special emphasis is laid on observing behaviour in its natural environment. The typical research methods are naturalistic observation and field experiment. Where films or tapes are made, ethologists have developed a number of techniques for concealed filming in order to not upset the natural flow of behaviour. Thus, a movie camera with an angle lens was used by the ethologist Iraneus Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972) to make his recordings. This enabled him to make recordings in a different direction from where the camera was pointed, and was intended to minimise selfconsciousness in the people he observed.",

He realised that if his theory of natural selection was to explain the evolution of animal species, then it also had to be able to account for behaviour. In fact, Darwin's work contains much material that would now be described as ethological, although it would be anachronistic to describe Darwin either as an ethologist or as the founder of ethology. The first person to use the term 'ethology' in its modern sense was Oscar Heinroth, in a paper published in 1911 (Thorpe, 1979) . The title of 'The father of modern ethology' was also applied to Konrad Lorenz (Huxley, 1963) , who became most famous for his writings on aggression. However, Lorenz acknowledged Heinroth as the source of his inspiration, and in one place defined ethology as 'the subject which Heinroth invented' (Thorpe, 1979) .",

He found that greylag geese would vocalise in one way when they were about to walk or fly as a family, in another way just before merely walking rapidly. These distinctive vocalisations he called 'intention movements', because they typically occurred just prior to performing the actual behaviour. Julian Huxley (1914) studied the diving bird known as the great crested grebe. He used the term 'display' to describe the complex postures and water 'dances' which he observed. Subsequently, Tinbergen proposed that behaviour itself could evolve specifically for its signalling value, and that it did so by exhibiting the twin qualities of conspicuousness and simplicity (Tinbergen, 1953) .",

                "text": "1 Distinctive goals can be seen, for example, in the process of driving a car. The superordinate goal of reaching one's destination may also involve subordinate goals, such as overtaking a slow-moving vehicle, crossing a difficult junction, or joining a main road in heavy traffic. So too social performance can be seen as having distinctive goals. In a job interview, the superordinate goal of the interviewer -to select the right person for the job -necessitates a number of subordinate goals, such as obtaining information from the interviewee, and establishing satisfactory rapport in order to achieve those ends. 2 The selective perception of cues is a key process in the performance of any skill. Not all information is of equal value: that is to say, the skilled performer may pay particular attention to certain types of information relevant to achieving their objective, while ignoring irrelevant information. Indeed, one mark of skilled performance may be to learn what input can be ignored. A skilled public speaker learns to sense the interest and attention of the audience, and to adjust the performance appropriately, whereas the conversational bore completely fails to read the response of his or her listeners. piece of information. The term 'translation' refers to the rule by which a particular signal is interpreted as regarding a particular action. An important feature of skills acquisition consists in the development of such translations which, once learned, can be readily and immediately acted upon. It is in the development of new translations that a great deal of hesitancy and halting can often be observed. 4 Motor responses refer to behaviours which are performed as a consequence of central translation processes. The learner driver may initially find it extremely difficult to change gear, but with practice the movements become quite automatic. So, too, with social behaviour. Initial learning may be quite awkward, but with extensive practice large chunks of behaviour can become fluent and habitual. Indeed, social behaviour can become too automatic. The monotone of museum guides who have repeated their guided tour too often is one well-known example of automatised behaviour. Similarly, there was the unfortunate case of a lecturer who reported that 'he had reached a stage where he could arise before his audience, turn his mouth loose, and go to sleep' (Lashley, 1951; cited in Argyle, 1969) . 5 Feedback and corrective action refer to the ways in which individuals may modify their behaviour in the light of feedback from others. Just as in a central heating system, where the information from a thermostat regulates the heating output, so too feedback is important in the context of social interaction. For example, a teacher who sees that pupils have not understood a point may repeat it slowly in another way; again, a salesman who realises that he is failing to make an impact may change his style of behaviour. Argyle proposed that feedback is obtained principally from nonverbal cues. So in conversation a speaker will typically scan the other's face intermittently to check whether the listener understands, agrees or disagrees, and whether he or she is willing for the speaker to continue talking. 6 Good timing and rhythm are also important features of social skills. Without correct anticipation as to when a response will be required, interaction can be jerky and ineffective. Taking turns is the characteristic way in which conversation is structured. In larger groups, turn-taking can sometimes be problematic, because opportunities to speak can be quite restricted. Choosing the right moment to make a point in a group discussion is a useful example of the social skill of good timing.",

Because of the anatomical complexity of bodily movement, it can be very difficult to give precise descriptions of its physical appearance. Nowhere is this more true than in the facial musculature, which is capable of producing an extensive array of different expressions. These are highly varied, often subtle and intricate and hence can be very difficult to describe. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a procedure for categorising facial movements, developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen (1978) . By concentrating on the anatomical basis of facial movement, FACS can provide a detailed description of all the movements possible with the facial musculature. Thus, the system is not only comprehensive, it can also serve as an invaluable guide to perception, by helping the observer to identify complex facial movements and providing a language with which to describe them. Indeed, FACS has become widely accepted as the main technique available for analysing facial expressions, and there is now an extensive body of research using this procedure (see Ekman and Rosenberg, 1997) .",

Thus, because of the complex structure of avoidance-avoidance conflict questions, it was hypothesised that they are more likely to be posed by professional interviewers than by members of the public.

Avoidanceavoidance questions are arguably tougher than those which allow a no necessary threat response, because they create pressures on the politician to equivocate. The relative proportion of such questions (referred to as level of threat) can be used as a measure of interviewer toughness: the higher the proportion of avoidance-avoidance questions, the tougher the interview. Level of threat can also used as a means of assessing interviewer neutrality. If it can be shown that an interviewer consistently asks a higher proportion of avoidance-avoidance questions to members of one political party rather than another, then it can be argued that this is indicative of interviewer bias.",

On this basis, an evaluation was conducted of avoidable face-damaging responses in interviews broadcast during the 1992 British General Election.

Spoken English is produced in groups of words, typically averaging about five in length, where there is one primary vocal stress, sometimes referred to as the 'tonic' (Halliday, 1970) . This primary vocal stress is conveyed principally through changes in pitch, but also through changes in loudness or rhythm. The group of words is referred to as a 'phonemic clause' or 'tone group', and is terminated by a juncture, in which the changes in pitch, rhythm and loudness level off before the beginning of the next phonemic clause (Trager and Smith, 1951) . Speakers of English typically accompany their primary stresses with slight jerks of the head or hand (Pittenger et al., 1960) . Furthermore, it is not just movements of the head and hands which are related to vocal stress, but movements of all parts of the body (Bull and Connelly, 1985) . In fact, most of the tonic stresses (over 90 per cent) in the study by Bull and Connelly were accompanied by some kind of body motion. Typically, these took the form of continuous movements, such as nodding the head or flexing and extending the forearm, where the apex of the movement was timed to occur at the same time as the tonic. So, for example, the downward movement of a head nod might begin before the tonic, the apex of the head nod coinciding with the tonic, the upward movement of the head occurring after the tonic.",

Larger chunks of speech can also be marked out through shifts in posture (Scheflen, 1964 (Scheflen, , 1973)) . Changes in what is referred to as the 'position' -corresponding roughly to taking a certain point of view in an interaction -tend to be accompanied by a postural shift involving at least half the body (Scheflen, 1964) . Changes of topic are also sometimes accompanied by shifts in posture: in a study of television newsreaders, it was found that the introduction of a different news item was frequently accompanied by a change in hand position (Bull, 1987) .",

According to Kendon (1985) , gesture is arguably as fundamental as speech for the representation of meaning; they are joined together only because gesture is used simultaneously for the same purpose. In the organisation of an utterance, speech and gesture are planned at the outset; the encoding of the utterance may occur simultaneously through both speech and gesture. There is considerable evidence consistent with this view (McNeill, 1985) . Not only do gestures occur primarily during speech, they are also synchronised with linguistic units; indeed, they have semantic and pragmatic functions that parallel those of speech. In addition, gesture develops simultaneously with speech in children, and dissolves together with speech in aphasia (any disorder of speech resulting from brain damage). Speech and gesture interact with one another in creating meaning. Not only does gesture clarify the meaning of the speech, speech can also clarify the meaning of the gesture (Kelly et al., 1999) . In short, gesture may be seen not just as an alternative to speech, but as an additional resource, as part of a multichannel system of communication, which allows the skilled speaker further options through which to convey meaning.",

It is, of course, first and foremost a visual means of communication. As such, it is often easier or quicker, for example, to point to an object than to describe it in words. Again, some gestures are like representative pictures in that they attempt to represent the visual appearance of an object, spatial relationship or bodily action (sometimes referred to as 'physiographic'). In one experiment (Graham and Argyle, 1975) , English and Italian students were asked to communicate information about two-dimensional shapes to other students from their own culture, both with and without the use of hand gestures. The decoders drew what they thought the shapes were, the drawings were rated by English and Italian judges for their similarity to the original shapes. When gesture was permitted, the drawings were judged as significantly more accurate, while the Italians also did significantly better than the English under these circumstances. Gesture is, of course, widely believed to be of particular importance in Italian culture.",

Whereas features like vocalisation, speech rate and amplitude are intrinsic to speech, that is to say, it is impossible to converse without them, it is perfectly possible to converse without the use of gesture. Consequently, the presence or absence of gesture may in itself be seen as a form of communication. Thus, gesture may be used when a person is interested in the topic he or she is talking about, or to accompany certain parts of speech which a person regards as more important. Similarly, it has been found that people attempting to be persuasive used significantly more gesture than when asked to present a message in a neutral fashion (Mehrabian and Williams, 1969) . Conversely, an absence of gesture may indicate a lack of desire to communicate. People suffering from depression were found to use significantly fewer illustrative gestures on admission to hospital than on discharge (Kiritz, 1971; cited in Ekman and Friesen, 1974) .",

In a study of a birthday party, it was observed how people used gesture as an initial salutation to capture one another's attention before entering into conversation (Kendon and Ferber, 1973) . In a study of medical consultations, patients were found to use flamboyant gestures to attract the doctor's attention when it was focussed on his or her notes (Heath, 1986) . In this context, gesture has the additional advantage of indirectness as well as visibility, since a direct request for attention from a higher-status figure like a doctor might be seen as some sort of challenge to the doctor's authority. There are also differences in visibility between different forms of gesture. More important aspects of speech can be indicated by larger movements (articulated from the shoulder, or indeed involving both arms), and/or by movements involving more than one part of the body. This is particularly true of a situation like public speaking. For the orator, gesture has distinct advantages over other forms of nonverbal communication such as facial expression or gaze, which may be less discernible to a distant audience. Politicians at public meetings are well known for the flamboyant use of gesture, hence this seemed a particularly good setting in which to examine the relationship of hand gestures to speech. Whereas the author's previous research had been based on conversations between students in a social psychology laboratory (e.g. Bull and Connelly, 1985) , the aim of this study was to analyse a naturalistic situation where hand gestures might be expected to occur with a high degree of frequency.",

The timing of applause is also characterised by a high degree of precision: typically it occurs either just before or immediately after a possible completion point by the speaker. Similarly, speakers usually wait until the applause has finished before starting or continuing to speak. In fact, just as conversationalists take it in turns to speak, so do speaker and audience, although audience 'turns' are essentially limited to gross displays of approval or disapproval (such as cheering or heckling). Indeed, as Atkinson points out, if the audience was not restricted in this way, it is hard to imagine how public meetings could ever take place in the ensuing verbal chaos!",

He argued that audiences are more likely to respond to statements that are constructed in such a way as to both emphasise and highlight the content, and which project a clear completion point for the message in question. Emphasis naturally calls attention to passages to which the speaker attaches particular significance, but Atkinson argues that emphasis alone is rarely sufficient to ensure a response. Projectability is also important, because audience members must decide not only if they will applaud but when to applaud; if the speech is constructed in such a way as to indicate appropriate applause points, this assists the audience in co-ordinating their behaviour. According to Atkinson (1984a, p. 18) , the use of rhetorical devices is in the interest of the audience, because it helps them applaud together rather than risk exposure to public ridicule and humiliation by applauding in isolation.",

In conversation, the completion of a list can signal the completion of an utterance -a point at which another person can or should start talking. Such lists also typically consist of three items, so that once the listener recognises that a list is under way, it is possible to anticipate the completion point and hence the end of the speaker's utterance (Jefferson, 1990) . In political speeches, Atkinson proposed that the three-part list may serve a comparable function, but in this case signalling to the audience appropriate places to applaud. For example, Tony Blair (at that time Leader of the Labour Opposition) was duly applauded in his speech to his party's annual conference (1 October, 1996) when he said that 'there is no future for Britain as a low wage, low skills, low technology economy'. He was also applauded for a more famous three-part list in the same speech: 'Ask me my three main priorities for Government, and I tell you: education, education and education.'",

John Major was duly applauded when he told the Conservative Party conference (11 October, 1996 ) that 'we are in Europe to help shape it and not to be shaped by it'. Contrasts can be used to do a number of things, including boasting about one's own side, attacking the opposition, or doing both things at the same time. To be effective, the second part of the contrast should closely resemble the first in the details of its construction and duration, so that the audience can more easily anticipate the point of completion. If the contrast is too brief, people may have insufficient time to recognise that a completion point is about to be reached, let alone to produce an appropriate response. According to Atkinson, the contrast is by far the most frequently used device for obtaining applause. He also proposed that the skilled use of both contrasts and three-part lists is characteristic of 'charismatic' speakers (Atkinson, 1984a, pp. 86-123) , and that such devices are often to be found in those passages of political speeches which are selected for presentation in the news media (Atkinson, 1984a, pp. 124-163) .",

They found that contrasts were associated with no less than 33.2 per cent of the incidences of collective applause during speeches, and lists with 12.6 per cent; hence, almost half the applause occurring during these 476 speeches was associated with the two rhetorical devices originally identified by Atkinson.",

                "text": "Five other rhetorical devices for obtaining applause were identified, referred to as puzzle-solution, headline-punchline, combination, position taking and pursuits (Heritage and Greatbatch, 1986 ). In the puzzlesolution device, the speaker begins by establishing some kind of puzzle or problem and then, shortly afterwards, offers the solution; this is the important and applaudable part of the message. The puzzle invites the audience to anticipate or guess at its solution, while at the same time listening carefully to the speaker's own solution when it is delivered. Since the delivery of the solution naturally coincides with the completion of the political message, the audience is normally able to anticipate the point at which applause should properly begin. For example, Paddy Ashdown was applauded for the solution to the puzzle posed in this speech to the annual Liberal Democrat Party Conference (24 September, 1996) The headline-punchline device is structurally similar to the puzzlesolution format, although somewhat simpler. Here, the speaker proposes to make a declaration, pledge or announcement and then proceeds to make it. The applaudable part of the message is emphasised by the speaker's calling attention in advance to what he or she is about to say. Thus, the speaker might use headline phrases such as 'I'll tell you what makes it worthwhile . . .', 'And I'll say why . . .', 'And I repeat the promise that I made at the election that . . .', 'And our number one priority is . . .' or 'And I can announce to you that . . .' In the following extract from a speech by Tony Blair to the Labour Party Conference (30 September, 1997), he states 'And I tell you that [HEADLINE] I will never countenance an NHS that departs from its fundamental principle of health care based on need not wealth' [PUNCHLINE] . The punchline 'need not wealth' also contains a contrast, and is duly applauded.",

This point is readily acknowledged by Atkinson, Heritage and Greatbatch, but they also propose that audiences are much more likely to applaud if content is expressed through an appropriate rhetorical device. For example, in an analysis of two debates at the Conservative and Labour Party conferences, Heritage and Greatbatch looked at one particular class of statements the audience might be expected to applaud, referred to as 'external attacks'. These are statements critical of outgroups such as other political parties, which should evoke unambiguous agreement amongst party conference participants. Whereas 71 per cent of external attacks expressed through one of the seven rhetorical devices were applauded, only 29 per cent of external attacks received applause in the absence of rhetorical devices.",

In the former, there was a clear consensus in favour of right-wing, Thatcherite policies; in the latter, there was an over-whelming sentiment in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament. It was found that most of the applauded statements were couched in one or more of the seven rhetorical devices identified by Heritage and Greatbatch (76.3 per cent of the pro-majority statements and 90 per cent of the pro-minority statements). Overall, the pro-majority position was applauded nine times as often as the minority one.

The manner in which a message is delivered may strongly complement and reinforce its rhetorical structure, providing further information to the audience that this is a point where applause would be appropriate (Atkinson, 1984a) . A sample of speeches formulated in one of the seven basic rhetorical devices was coded in terms of the degree of 'stress' (Heritage and Greatbatch, 1986) . Stress was evaluated in terms of whether the speaker was gazing at the audience at or near the completion point of the message, whether the message was delivered more loudly than surrounding speech passages, or with greater pitch or stress variation, or with some kind of rhythmic shift or accompanied by the use of gestures. In the absence of any of these features, the message was coded 'no stress'. One of these features was treated as sufficient for a coding of 'intermediate stress', while the presence of two or more features was categorised as 'full stress'. Over one half of the 'fully stressed' messages were applauded, only one quarter of the 'intermediate' messages attracted a similar response and this figure fell to less than 5 per cent in the case of the 'unstressed' messages.

This system is intended to enable the investigator to describe in detail the visual appearance of body movements. It takes as its basic unit of analysis the single movement act; hence, the system describes gestures as a series of movements rather than as a series of positions. A basic distinction is made between those movements which involve contact with an object or part of the body and those which do not involve any such contact. Body-contact and object-contact acts are described in terms of the way the contact is made (e.g. touching, grasping, scratching), the part of the body which makes the contact and the object or part of the body with which the contact is made. Non-contact acts are described in terms of the various movements which are possible from each of the major joints of the body -in the case of hand/arm movements, from the shoulder, elbow, wrist and finger joints. For example, the forearm can flex, extend, rotate inwards and rotate outwards; these movements can also be performed in combination with one another. Reliability for scoring hand/arm movements was satisfactorily demonstrated in a previous study (Bull and Connelly, 1985) with a k coefficient of 0.81 (Cohen, 1960) between two independent scorers.",

In addition, the speech was classified into different speech acts, following principles for content analysis devised by Thomas et al. (1982) in a system called Conversation Exchange Analysis (CEA). In this system, speech is segmented into separate acts, each of which can be seen to represent a single thought or idea. Acts can be further classified along three dimensions: activity, type and focus. The type dimension was used in this study to categorise the type of information conveyed in the speech by Arthur Scargill; the categories employed were based on CEA and on the work of Atkinson, Heritage and Greatbatch. A high degree of reliability for CEA has been demonstrated in a previous study: the division into speech acts was achieved with just 3.93 per cent inter-observer disagreement, while a k coefficient (Cohen, 1960) of 0.957 was obtained for the type dimension (Thomas et al., 1982) .",

Where a movement is repeated on a number of occasions, e.g. flexes and extends forearm (five times), this would be scored as five movements.

Some can be regarded as preparatory movements, in which, for example, the speaker flexes his forearm before bringing it down to coincide with the stressed word. Other movements can be seen to terminate a clause, where the speaker extends his forearm after a sequence of stress-related movements. A third category consists of movements in a repeated sequence of gestures, where the apex of the movement does not always coincide with the vocal stress; for example, in a sequence of five repeated forearm movements, two may not actually coincide directly with the vocal stress. If gestures indirectly related to vocal stress are included in the total of stress-related movements, the proportion rises to 87.5 per cent for Pat Wall and 59 per cent for Martin Leathley.",

In the case of Martin Leathley, 40 per cent of his hand gestures appeared to be totally unrelated to vocal stress. Again, these were mainly contact gestures, in which Martin Leathley shifted his hand on the rostrum (30 per cent of all hand movements); but there were also a number of non-contact movements (N \u03ed 25, 9 per cent of all hand movements), as well as a couple of movements in which Leathley turned over his notes.

In Pat Wall's speech, 56 of these multiple apex peaks were observed, none of which crossed tone group boundaries, i.e. the total length of the gestural sequence occurred within the duration of the tone group. Similarly, in Martin Leathley's speech, there were 15 multiple apex peaks, again none of which violated tone group boundaries. Hence, these multiple apex peaks seemed to serve a dual function: they both picked out stressed words, and demarcated the extent of the tone group. Overall, the majority of hand movements of both speakers were related directly or indirectly to vocal stress; hand movements not related to stress typically took the form of contact movements, where the speaker adjusted the position of his hand on the rostrum.",

In eight out of the ten contrasts, he illustrated one part of the contrast with one hand, the other part of the contrast with the other hand. However, this should not be seen as a device which is simply confined to illustrating contrasts. Switching from one hand to the other is a characteristic feature of Arthur Scargill's speaking style; in fact, in this speech it occurred on no less than 80 occasions. Contrasts typically involve a transition from one syntactic clause to another (eight out of the ten contrasts in this speech), and an examination of the speech as a whole showed that 62.5 per cent of the hand switches occurred at clause boundaries. The other incidences of hand switching also occurred at syntactic boundaries: at the end of a prepositional phrase (12.5%), at a subject/verb boundary (5%), at a verb/object boundary (5%) and to separate items in a list (14%).

However, on the other eight occasions, these gestures occurred just before a point in the speech where applause might be considered more appropriate, typically when Arthur Scargill was about to invite applause through one of the rhetorical devices discussed above (p. 40).",

At the same time, he whipped up applause by using rhetorical devices, the structure of which was articulated by the carefully synchronised use of hand gestures. These gestures singled out pairs of statements in a contrast, picked out the items in three-part lists and highlighted climaxes. In fact, Arthur Scargill actually seemed to conduct his audience: his gestures not only accompanied rhetorical devices which invited applause, but also curtailed the applause once it had been invited -even to the extent of indicating points at which applause was or was not appropriate.",
